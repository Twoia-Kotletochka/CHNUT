<strong> 1 -  Introduction

<hr><p><a name="16173"></a>
This chapter introduces the <em>Java Native Interface</em> (JNI). The JNI is a native 
programming interface. It allows Java code that runs inside a Java Virtual Machine<B>*</B> (VM) 
to interoperate with applications and libraries written in other 
programming languages, such as C, C++, and assembly.
<p><a name="426"></a>
The most important benefit of the JNI is that it imposes no restrictions on the 
implementation of the underlying Java VM. Therefore, Java VM vendors can 
add support for the JNI without affecting other parts of the VM. Programmers 
can write one version of a native application or library and expect it to work 
with all Java VMs supporting the JNI.

<h1> Java Native Interface Overview
</h1>
<a name="16636"></a>
While you can write applications entirely in Java, there are situations where 
Java alone does not meet the needs of your application. Programmers use the 
JNI to write <em>Java native methods</em> to handle those situations when an application 
cannot be written entirely in Java. 
<p><a name="16650"></a>
The following examples illustrate when you need to use Java native methods:
<p><ul><a name="16651"></a>
<li>The standard Java class library does not support the platform-dependent 
features needed by the application. 

<a name="16654"></a>
<li>You already have a library written in another language, and wish to make it 
accessible to Java code through the JNI. 

<a name="16656"></a>
<li>You want to implement a small portion of time-critical code in a lower-level 
language such as assembly.

</ul><a name="16395"></a>
By programming through the JNI, you can use native methods to:
<p><ul><a name="16398"></a>
<li>Create, inspect, and update Java objects (including arrays and strings).

<a name="16396"></a>
<li>Call Java methods.

<a name="16404"></a>
<li>Catch and throw exceptions.

<a name="16407"></a>
<li>Load classes and obtain class information.

<a name="16659"></a>
<li>Perform runtime type checking.

</ul><a name="16360"></a>
You can also use the JNI with the <em>Invocation API</em> to enable an arbitrary native 
application to embed the Java VM. This allows programmers to easily make 
their existing applications Java-enabled without having to link with the VM 
source code.

<h1> Background
</h1>
<a name="16412"></a>
Currently, VMs from different vendors offer different native method interfaces. 
These different interfaces force programmers to produce, maintain, and 
distribute multiple versions of native method libraries on a given platform. 
<p><a name="16679"></a>
We briefly examine some of the existing native method interfaces, such as:
<p><ul><a name="16685"></a>
<li>JDK 1.0 native method interface

<a name="16688"></a>
<li>Netscape's Java Runtime Interface

<a name="16689"></a>
<li>Microsoft's Raw Native Interface and Java/COM interface

</ul><br><a name="16684"></a>
<h2>		 JDK 1.0 Native Method Interface
</h2>
<a name="16555"></a>
JDK 1.0 shipped with a native method interface. Unfortunately, there are two 
major reasons that this interface is unsuitable for adoption by other Java VMs. 
<p><a name="16700"></a>
First, the native code accesses fields in Java objects as members of C structures. 
However, the <em>Java Language Specification</em> does not define how objects are laid 
out in memory. If a Java VM lays out objects differently in memory, then the 
programmer would have to recompile the native method libraries. 
<p><a name="16705"></a>
Second, JDK 1.0's native method interface relies on a conservative garbage 
collector. The unrestricted use of the <code>unhand</code> macro, for example, makes it 
necessary to conservatively scan the native stack.
<p><br><a name="16413"></a>
<h2>		 Java Runtime Interface
</h2>
<a name="16706"></a>
Netscape proposed the Java Runtime Interface (JRI), a general interface for 
services provided in the Java virtual machine. JRI is designed with portability 
in mind---it makes few assumptions about the implementation details in the 
underlying Java VM. The JRI addresses a wide range of issues, including 
native methods, debugging, reflection, embedding (invocation), and so on.
<p><br><a name="16442"></a>
<h2>		 Raw Native Interface and Java/COM Interface
</h2>
<a name="16707"></a>
The Microsoft Java VM supports two native method interfaces. At the low 
level, it provides an efficient Raw Native Interface (RNI). The RNI offers a high 
degree of source-level backward compatibility with the JDK's native method 
interface, although it has one major difference. Instead of relying on 
conservative garbage collection, the native code must use RNI functions to 
interact explicitly with the garbage collector. 
<p><a name="16713"></a>
At a higher level, Microsoft's Java/COM interface offers a language-
independent standard binary interface to the Java VM. Java code can use a 
COM object as if it were a Java object. A Java class can also be exposed to the 
rest of the system as a COM class.
<p><hr align=left><a name="16410"></a>
<h1> Objectives
</h1>
<a name="16664"></a>
We believe that a uniform, well-thought-out standard interface offers the 
following benefits for everyone:
<p><ul><a name="16184"></a>
<li>Each VM vendor can support a larger body of native code.

<a name="16186"></a>
<li>Tool builders will not have to maintain different kinds of native method 
interfaces.

<a name="16268"></a>
<li>Application programmers will be able to write one version of their native 
code and this version will run on different VMs.

</ul><a name="16250"></a>
The best way to achieve a standard native method interface is to involve all 
parties with an interest in Java VMs. Therefore we organized a series of 
discussions among the Java licensees on the design of a uniform native method 
interface. It is clear from the discussions that the standard native method 
interface must satisfy the following requirements:
<p><ul><a name="16251"></a>
<li>Binary compatibility - The primary goal is binary compatibility of native 
method libraries across all Java VM implementations on a given platform. 
Programmers should maintain only one version of their native method 
libraries for a given platform. 

<a name="16463"></a>
<li>Efficiency - To support time-critical code, the native method interface must 
impose little overhead. All known techniques to ensure VM-independence 
(and thus binary compatibility) carry a certain amount of overhead. We 
must somehow strike a compromise between efficiency and VM-
independence.

<a name="16464"></a>
<li>Functionality - The interface must expose enough Java VM internals to 
allow native methods to accomplish useful tasks.

</ul><hr align=left><a name="16465"></a>
<h1> <strong></strong>Java Native Interface Approach
</h1>
<a name="16528"></a>
We hoped to adopt one of the existing approaches as the standard interface, 
because this would have imposed the least burden on programmers who had 
to learn multiple interfaces in different VMs. Unfortunately, no existing 
solutions are completely satisfactory in achieving our goals.
<p><a name="16473"></a>
Netscape's JRI is the closest to what we envision as a portable native method 
interface, and was used as the starting point of our design. Readers familiar 
with the JRI will notice the similarities in the API naming convention, the use 
of method and field IDs, the use of local and global references, and so on. 
Despite our best efforts, however, the JNI is not binary-compatible with the JRI, 
although a VM can support both the JRI and the JNI.
<p><a name="16835"></a>
Microsoft's RNI is an improvement over JDK 1.0 because it solves the problem 
of native methods working with a nonconservative garbage collector. The RNI, 
however, is not suitable as a VM-independent native method interface. Like the 
JDK, RNI native methods access Java objects as C structures. This leads to two 
problems:
<p><ul><a name="438"></a>
<li>RNI exposes the layout of internal Java objects to native code.

<a name="452"></a>
<li>Direct access of Java objects as C structures makes it impossible to efficiently 
incorporate "write barriers," which are necessary in advanced garbage 
collection algorithms.

</ul><a name="16838"></a>
As a binary standard, COM ensures complete binary compatibility across 
different VMs. Invoking a COM method requires only an indirect call, which 
carries little overhead. In addition, COM objects are a great improvement over 
dynamic-link libraries in solving versioning problems. 
<p><a name="16815"></a>
The use of COM as the standard Java native method interface, however, is 
hampered by a few factors: 
<p><ul><a name="343"></a>
<li>First, the Java/COM interface lacks certain desired functions, such as 
accessing private fields and raising general exceptions. 

<a name="456"></a>
<li>Second, the Java/COM interface automatically provides the standard 
IUnknown and IDispatch COM interfaces for Java objects, so that native 
code can access public methods and fields. Unfortunately, the IDispatch 
interface does not deal with overloaded Java methods and is case-
insensitive in matching method names. Furthermore, all Java methods 
exposed through the IDispatch interface are wrapped to perform dynamic 
type checking and coercion. This is because the IDispatch interface is 
designed with weakly-typed languages (such as Basic) in mind.

<a name="344"></a>
<li>Third, instead of dealing with individual low-level functions, COM is 
designed to allow software components (including full-fledged applications) 
to work together. We believe that it is not appropriate to treat all Java classes 
or low-level native methods as software components. 

<a name="345"></a>
<li>Fourth, the immediate adoption of COM is hampered by the lack of its 
support on UNIX platforms.

</ul><a name="16519"></a>
Although we do not expose Java objects to the native code as COM objects, the 
JNI interface itself is binary-compatible with COM. We use the same jump 
table structure and calling convention that COM does. <em>This means that, as soon 
as cross-platform support for COM is available, the JNI can become a COM interface 
to the Java VM.
</em><p><a name="16492"></a>
We do not believe that the JNI should be the only native method interface 
supported by a given Java VM. A standard interface benefits programmers 
who would like to load their native code libraries into different Java VMs. In 
some cases, the programmer may have to use a lower-level, VM-specific 
interface to achieve top efficiency. In other cases, the programmer might use a 
higher-level interface to build software components. Indeed, we hope that, as 
the Java environment and component software technologies become more 
mature, native methods will gradually lose their significance.
<p><hr align=left><a name="16539"></a>
<h1> Programming to the JNI
</h1>
<a name="16540"></a>
Native method programmers should start programming to the JNI. 
Programming to the JNI insulates you from unknowns, such as the vendor's 
VM that the end user might be running. By conforming to the JNI standard, 
you will give a native library the best chance to run in a given Java VM. For 
example, although JDK 1.1 will continue to support the old-style native 
method interface that was implemented in JDK 1.0, it is certain that future 
versions of the JDK will stop supporting the old-style native method interface. 
Native methods relying on the old-style interface will have to be rewritten.
<p><a name="16546"></a>
If you are implementing a Java VM, you should implement the JNI. We 
(Javasoft and the licensees) have tried our best to ensure that the JNI does not 
impose any overhead or restrictions on your VM implementation, including 
object representation, garbage collection scheme, and so on. Please let us know 
if you run into any problems we might have overlooked.
<p><hr align=left><a name="00002"></a>
<h1> Changes in JDK 1.1.2
</h1>

<p>
To better support the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Invocation
API has been extended in JDK 1.1.2 in a few minor ways. The changes do
not break any existing code. The JNI Native Method Interface has not
been changed.

<ul>
<li>
The <code>reserved0</code> field in the <code>JDK1_1InitArgs</code>
structure has been renamed to <code>version</code>. The
<code>JDK1_1InitArgs</code> structure holds the initialization
arguments to <code>JNI_CreateJavaVM</code>. Callers of
<code>JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs</code> and
<code>JNI_CreateJavaVM</code> must set the version field to
<code>0x00010001</code>. <code>JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs</code> has
been changed to return a <code>jint</code> indicating whether the
requested version is supported.

<li>
The <code>reserved1</code> field in the <code>JDK1_1InitArgs</code>
structure has been renamed to <code>properties</code>. This is a
<code>NULL</code>-terminated array of strings. Each string has the
format:

<blockquote>
name=value 
</blockquote>

indicating a system property. (This facility corresponds to the -D
option in the java command line.)

<li>In JDK 1.1.1, the thread calling <code>DestroyJavaVM</code> must
be the only user thread in the VM. JDK 1.1.2 has lifted this
restriction. If <code>DestroyJavaVM</code> is called when there is
more than one user thread, the VM waits until the current thread is
the only user thread, and then tries to destroy itself.
</ul>
