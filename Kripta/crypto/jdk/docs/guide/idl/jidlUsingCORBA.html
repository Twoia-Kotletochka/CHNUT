<H2>About CORBA</H2></A>


<P>
CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
is the standard distributed object architecture developed
by the Object Management Group (OMG) consortium.  Since 1989
the mission of the OMG has been the specification of an
architecture for an open software bus, or Object Request Broker
(ORB), on which object components written by different vendors
can interoperate across networks and operating systems.
This standard allows CORBA objects to invoke
one another without knowing where the objects they access reside or in
what language the requested objects are implemented. 
The OMG-specified Interface Definition Language (IDL) is used to define
the interfaces to CORBA objects.

<P>CORBA objects
differ from typical programming language objects in
these ways:

<UL>
   <LI>CORBA objects can be located anywhere on a network.

   <LI>CORBA objects can interoperate with objects
   on other platforms. 
 
   <LI>CORBA objects can be written in any programming language for which
   there is a mapping from OMG IDL to that language.  (Mappings
   currently specified include Java, C++, C, Smalltalk, COBOL, and Ada.)
</UL>


<A NAME="second"><H2>About Java IDL</H2></A> 
Java IDL is an Object Request Broker provided with the Java 2 Platform. 
Together with the <code>idltojava</code> compiler 
(<a href="http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/earlyAccess/jdk12/idltojava.html">downloadable from the Java Developer
Connection</a>), it can be used to define, implement, and access CORBA
objects from the Java programming language. 
Java IDL is compliant with the 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doclist.pl">
CORBA/IIOP 2.0 Specification</a> (orbos/97-02-25)
and the 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/library/schedule/IDL_to_Java_RFP.htm">
IDL-to-Java Language Mapping</a> (orbos/98-01-06 Final).

<P>
The Java IDL ORB supports transient CORBA objects - objects whose lifetimes
are limited by their server process's lifetime. Java IDL also provides a transient

nameserver to organize objects into a tree-directory structure. The nameserver
is compliant with the Naming Service Specification described in 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/corba/csindx.htm">CORBAservices:
Common Object Services Specification</a>. Transient objects and the nameserver
are discussed later in this page. 

<p>
No interface repository is provided as part of Java IDL. An interface repository 
is not required because under normal circumstances, clients have access to generated
stub files.

<a name="third">
<h2>CORBA Concepts in a Nutshell</h2></a>

<P>The concepts introduced in this section are more completely discussed
in the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doclist.pl">
CORBA/IIOP 2.0 Specification</a>. 

<P>
The diagram below shows a method request sent from a client to a 
CORBA object implementation in a server. A client is any code (perhaps itself
a CORBA object) that invokes a
method on a CORBA object. The servant is an instance of the object
implementation -  the actual code and
data that implements the CORBA object. 

<P><center><IMG SRC="images/requestpath.gif" ALT="[requestpath image]"></center>

<P>
The client of a CORBA object has an object reference for the object
and the client uses this object reference to issue method requests. 
If the server object is remote, the object reference points to a 
stub function, which uses the ORB machinery to forward invocations
to the server object. The stub code uses the ORB to identify the 
machine that runs the server object and asks that machine's ORB for
a connection to the object's server. 
When the stub code has the connection, it sends the object reference and
parameters to the skeleton code linked to the destination object's 
implementation. The skeleton code transforms the call and parameters into
the required implementation-specific format and calls the object. Any 
results or exceptions are returned along the same path.

<P>The 
client has no knowledge of the CORBA object's location, implementation details,
nor which ORB is used to access the object. Different ORBs communicate via
the OMG-specified Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP). 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doclist.pl">[CORBA/IIOP 2.0:ch 9,10]  
</a>

<P>
A client may only invoke methods that are specified in the CORBA object's
interface. 
A CORBA object's interface is defined using the OMG Interface
Definition Language (IDL) 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doclist.pl">[CORBA/IIOP 2.0 ch3]</a>.  
An interface defines an object type and
specifies a set of named methods and parameters, as well as the exception
types that these methods may return. An IDL compiler such as <code>
idltojava</code> translates the CORBA object definitions into a specific
programming language according to the appropriate OMG language
mapping. Thus, the <code>idltojava</code> compiler translates IDL defintions
into Java constructs according to the IDL-Java language mapping. 

<P>
The stub and skeleton files are generated by the <code>idltojava</code> 
compiler for each
object type. Stub files present the client with access to IDL-defined methods
in the client programming language. The server skeleton files glue the object
implementation to the ORB runtime. The ORB uses the skeletons to dispatch
methods to the object implementation instances (servants).

<a name="fourth"><h2>
Defining and Implementing CORBA Objects
</h2></a>

<P>
The goal in CORBA object development is the creation and registration of
an <i>object server</i>, or simply <i>server</i>. A server is a program which
contains the implementation of one or more object types and which has been
registered with the ORB. For example, you might develop a desktop publishing
server which implements a "Document" object type, a "Paragraph" object type, 
and other related object types.

<h3>  
CORBA Object Interfaces
</h3>

<P>
All CORBA objects support an IDL interface; the IDL
interface defines an object type.
An interface can inherit from one or more other interfaces. IDL
syntax is very similar to that of Java or C++, and an IDL
file is functionally
the CORBA language-independent analog to a C++ header file.
IDL is mapped into each programming language to provide
access to object interfaces from that
language. With Java IDL, these IDL interfaces
can be translated to Java using the <code>idltojava</code> compiler. 
For each IDL interface, <TT>idltojava</TT> generates
a Java interface and the other <TT>.java</TT> files needed,
including a client stub and a server skeleton.

<P>
An IDL interface declares a set of client accessible operations,
exceptions, and typed attributes (values).
Each operation has a signature that defines
its name, parameters, result, and exceptions.
A simple IDL interface that describes the classic "Hello
World" program, follows.</P>

<PRE>
module HelloApp
{
  interface Hello
  {
    string sayHello();
    };
};
</PRE>

<P>
An operation may raise an exception when an error condition arises. The type
of the exception indicates the kind of error that was encountered. Clients
must be prepared to handle defined exceptions and CORBA standard exceptions
for each operation in addition to normal results.

<h3>Java Language-based Implementation</h3>
<p>
Once the IDL interfaces have been defined and the <code>
idltojava</code> compiler run on the <code>.idl</code> file,
 <code>.java</code> files containing
the method implementations may be written. The <code>.java</code>
implementation files are then compiled and linked with the <code>idltojava</code>
-generated <code>.java</code> files and the ORB library to create an
object server.   
<P>
An object implementation defines the behavior for all the operations
and attributes of the interface it supports. There may be multiple 
implementations of an interface, each designed to emphasize a 
specific time and space
trade-off, for example. The implementation defines the behavior of the interface
and object creation/destruction. 

<P>
Since only servers can create new CORBA objects, a <i>factory object</i>
interface should be defined and implemented for each object type. For 
example, if Document is an object type, a DocumentFactory object type
with a create method should be defined and implemented as part
of the server. (Note that "create" is not reserved; any method name may be
used.) The implementation of the create method can then use
<code>new</code> to create the object. For example:

<PRE>
  DocumentServant document  = new DocumentServant():
  orb.connect(document); 
</PRE> 

<P>
A <code>destroy</code> method may be defined and implemented on Document;
or, the object may be intended to persist indefinitely. (Again, "destroy"
is not reserved and any name may be used.)

<p>
The Java IDL ORB supports transient objects only - objects whose lifetime
is limited by the server process lifetime. Although a transient object 
dissapears when its server process stops running, the object may be 
implemented to store
its state in a file and to re-initialize itself
from this file at creation time.   


<a name="fifth">
<h2>Client Implementation
</h2></a>

<p>
Client code is linked with <code>idltojava</code>-generated .java
files and the ORB library. Examples of application and applet clients
are provided in the Hello World example.

<p>
Clients may only create CORBA objects via the published
factory interfaces that the server provides.  
Likewise, a client may only delete a CORBA object if that object publishes
a destruction method. 
Since a CORBA object may be shared by many clients around a
network, only the object server is in a position to know when the object
has become garbage.
</P>

<p>
The client code's only way of issuing method requests on a CORBA object
is via the object's object reference. The object reference is an opaque
structure which identifies a CORBA object's host machine, the port on which
the host server is listening for requests, and a pointer to the specific
object in the process. Because Java IDL supports only transient objects,
this object reference becomes invalid if the server process has stopped
and restarted.

<p>
Clients typically obtain object references in the following ways: 

<UL>
   <LI>from a factory object. For example, the client could invoke a
create method on DocumentFactory object in order to create a new Document.
The DocumentFactory create method would return an object refererence 
for Document to
the client. 
   <LI>from the nameservice. For example, the client could obtain an object
reference for the DocumentFactory by issuing a request on the nameservice. 
   <LI>From a string that was specially created from an object
   reference
</UL> 
 
<P>Once an object reference is obtained, the client must <I>narrow</I> it
to the appropriate type.
IDL supports inheritance; the root of its hierarchy is
<CODE>Object</CODE> in IDL, <CODE>org.omg.CORBA.Object</CODE> in
Java. (<CODE>org.omg.CORBA.Object</CODE> is, of course, a subclass
of <CODE>java.lang.Object</CODE>.) Some operations, notably name
lookup and unstringifying, return an <CODE>org.omg.CORBA.Object</CODE>,
which you narrow (using a helper class generated by the
idltojava compiler) to the derived type you want the object to
be. CORBA objects must be explicitly narrowed because the Java
runtime cannot always know the exact type of a CORBA object. </P>

<h2>Java IDL Transient Name Server</h2>
</a>
 
<P>
The Java IDL Transient Nameservice is an object server provided with
Java IDL. Use <code>tnameserv</code> at the command line prompt to start
the Name Server. This object server conforms to the standard object
implementation and invocation techniques described in the previous
sections of this page. 

<P>The Name Server stores object references by name in a tree
structure similar to a file directory. 
A client may lookup or <i>resolve</i>
object references by name. Because the Name Server is an ordinary
Java IDL transient server, the entire directory structure of names
is lost each time <code>tnameserv</code> stops running.
