<blockquote>
Two implementations of the Java virtual machine are available for 
J2SE 1.3:
<blockquote>
<a href="#client">Java HotSpot<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Client VM</a> 
<br><a href="#server"><a href="#server">Java HotSpot Server VM</a> 
</blockquote>
The Solaris and Linux versions of J2SE 1.3 
ship with both VM implementations.  The Win32 version of J2SE 1.3 
contains only the Java HotSpot Client VM.  The Java HotSpot Server VM 
for Win32 platforms is available as a separate download from the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot">Java HotSpot web site</a>.
<p>
Some features of Java HotSpot technology, common to both VM implementations, 
are the following. 
<ul>
<li><em>Adaptive compiler</em> - Applications are launched using a standard interpreter, but the code is then analyzed 
as it runs to detect performance bottlenecks, or "hot spots". 
The Java HotSpot Client VM compiles those performance-critical portions of the code for a boost 
in performance, while avoiding unnecessary compilation of seldom-used 
code (most of the program). The Client VM also 
uses the adaptive compiler to decide, on the fly, how best to optimize 
compiled code with techniques such as in-lining. The runtime analysis 
performed by the compiler allows it to eliminate guesswork in determining 
which optimizations will yield the largest performance benefit.
<p>
<li><em>Improved memory allocation and garbage collection</em> - 
The Java HotSpot Client VM allocates memory for objects 
more quickly than the classic virtual machine. 
The Client VM also  
has a state-of-the-art garbage collector that is faster and 
more efficient than the garbage collector of the classic VM.  
<p>
<li><em>Thread synchronization</em> - The Java programming language 
allows for use of multiple, concurrent paths of program execution 
(called "threads").  The Java HotSpot Client VM provides a 
leaner, speedier 
thread-handling capability that is designed to scale readily for use 
in large, shared-memory multiprocessor servers.  
</ul>

<h3>The Java HotSpot Client VM</h3></a>
The Java HotSpot Client Virtual Machine<b>*</b> serves as a replacement for both 
the "classic" virtual machine and the Just-in-time (JIT) compilers used by 
previous versions of the Java 2 SDK to offer improved runtime performance 
for applications and applets.  The Java HotSpot Client VM has 
been specially tuned to reduce application start-up time and memory 
footprint, making it particulary well suited for client environments. 
<p>
On all platforms, the Java application launcher (the <tt>java</tt> utility) 
will use Java HotSpot Client VM by default when launching applications.  
For more information, see
<ul>
<li><a href="../../tooldocs/win32/java.html">Java application 
launcher reference page</a>
<li><a href="../../tooldocs/win32/appletviewer.html">Appletviewer 
reference page</a>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="server">
<h3>Java HotSpot Server VM</h3></a>
The Java HotSpot Server VM is similar to the Java HotSpot Client VM, 
except that it has been specially tuned to maximize peak operating speed. 
It is intended for running long-running server applications, for which 
having the fastest possible operating speed is generally more important 
than having the fastest possible start-up time.
<p>
The Solaris and Linux versions of J2SE 1.3 ship with the Java HotSpot 
Server VM pre-installed.  The Java HotSpot Server VM for Win32 platforms 
is available as a separate download from the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot">Java HotSpot web site</a>. 
<p>
To invoke the Java HotSpot Server VM rather than the default Java HotSpot 
Client VM, use the <tt>-server</tt> option of the Java application launcher. 
For example:
<blockquote><pre>
java -server MyApp
</pre></blockquote>
