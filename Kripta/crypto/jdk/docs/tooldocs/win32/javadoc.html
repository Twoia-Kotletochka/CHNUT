<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>javadoc</strong> [ <a href="#options">options</a> ] [ packagenames ] [ sourcefiles ] [ <a href="#argumentfile">@files</a> ]
</pre>
Arguments can be in any order.<br>
<blockquote>
<dl>
     <dt><a href="#options"><code>options</code></a>
         <dd>Command-line options, as specified in this document.
             To see a typical use of javadoc options, see 
             <a href="#realworldexample">Real-World Example</a>.

     <dt><code>packagenames</code>
         <dd>A series of names of packages, 
             separated by spaces, such as 
             <code>java.lang&nbsp;java.lang.reflect&nbsp;java.awt</code>.
             You must separately specify each package you want to document.
             Javadoc uses <a href="#sourcepath"><code>-sourcepath</code></a>
             to look for these package names.  Javadoc does not recursively 
             traverse subpackages. 
             Wildcards such as asterisks (*) are not allowed.
             See <a href="#documentingpackages">Example - Documenting 
             One or More Packages</a>

     <dt><code>sourcefiles</code>
         <dd>A series of source file names, separated by spaces,
             each of which can begin with a path and contain a wildcard
             such as asterisk (*).
             The path that precedes the source file name determines
             where javadoc will look for it. (Javadoc does <i>not</i>
             use <code>-sourcepath</code> to look for these source file names.)
             For example, passing in <code>Button.java</code> is identical
             to <code>.\Button.java</code>.  An example source file name with
             a full path is <code>C:\src\java\awt\Graphics*.java</code>.
             See <a href="#documentingclasses">Example - Documenting 
             One or More Classes</a>.  You can also mix packagenames and
             sourcefiles, as in 
             <a href="#documentingboth">Example - Documenting Both
             Packages and Classes</a>

     <dt><a href="#argumentfile"><code>@files</code></a>
         <dd>One or more files that contain packagenames and  
             sourcefiles in any order, one name per line.

<!--  PERHAPS WE WILL FORMALIZE SOME DAY:
         <dd>One or more files that contain any of the previous 
             arguments in any order.

<!-- =================== DESCRIPTION ======================= -->

<a name="description"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
<b>Javadoc</b><SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> 
parses the declarations and documentation comments in a set of Java source
files and produces a corresponding set of HTML pages describing (by default) 
the public and protected classes, inner classes, interfaces, constructors, 
methods, and fields.  
<p>
You can run Javadoc on <a href="#documentingpackages">entire packages</a>,
<a href="#documentingclasses">individual source files</a>,
or <a href="#documentingboth">both</a>.
In the first case, you pass in as an argument to <code>javadoc</code> 
a series of package names.  In the second case you pass in 
a series of source (<code>.java</code>) filenames.  
<a href="#examples">Examples</a> are given at the end of this document.
<p>
<blockquote>
   <b>NOTE</b> - When you pass in package names to Javadoc, it currently 
   processes all <code>.java</code> classes in the specified package directories, 
   even if the <code>.java</code> files are code examples or other classes that
   are not actually members of the specified packages.  It does not parse each
   <code>.java</code> file for a package declaration; we may add this parsing
   in a future release.
</blockquote>

Javadoc produces one complete document each time it is run;  it cannot 
do incremental builds -- that is, it cannot modify or <i>directly</i> 
incorporate results from previous runs of Javadoc.  However, it can 
<a href="#link">link</a> to results from previous runs. 
<p>

As implemented, Javadoc requires and relies on the java compiler to do 
its job. Javadoc calls part of <code>javac</code> to compile the 
declarations, ignoring the member implementation. It builds a rich
internal representation of the classes, including the class hierarchy,
and "use" relationships, then generates the HTML from that.  Javadoc 
also picks up user-supplied documentation from
<a href="#documentationcomments">documentation comments</a> in the
source code.
<p>

In fact, Javadoc will run on <code>.java</code> source files that are 
pure stub files with no method bodies. This means you can write documentation
comments and run Javadoc in the earliest stages of design while creating
the API, before writing the implementation.
<p>

Relying on the compiler ensures that the HTML output corresponds exactly 
with the actual implementation, which may rely on implicit, rather
than explicit, source code. For example, Javadoc documents
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/8.doc.html#16823"> default 
constructors</a> (section 8.6.7 of <i>Java Language Specification</i>) 
that are present in the <code>.class</code> files but not in the source 
code. 
<p>

When Javadoc builds its internal structure for the documentation, it
loads all referenced classes.  Because of this, Javadoc must be able
to find all referenced classes, whether bootstrap classes, extensions,
or user classes.  For more about this, see 
<a href="../findingclasses.html">How Classes Are Found</a>. 
Generally speaking, classes you create must either be loaded as an
extension or in Javadoc's class path.
<p>

<!-- ====================== DOCLETS ========================= -->

<a name="doclets"></a>
<h3>Javadoc Doclets</h3>

You can customize the content and format of Javadoc's output by 
using doclets. Javadoc has a default "built-in" doclet, called
the standard doclet, that generates HTML-formatted API documentation.
You can modify or subclass the standard doclet, or write your own
doclet to generate HTML, XML, MIF, RTF or whatever output format
you'd like.  Information about doclets and their use is at 
the following locations:
<ul>
<li><a href="../javadoc/index.html">Javadoc Doclets</a>
<li><a href="#doclet">The <code>-doclet</code> command-line option</a>
</ul>  
When a custom doclet is not specified with the <tt>-doclet</tt> command 
line option, Javadoc will use the default standard doclet. The javadoc 
tool has several command line options that are 
available regardless of which doclet is being used. The 
standard doclet adds a supplementary set of command 
line options. Both sets of options are described below in the 
<a href="#options">options</a> section.

      packages, classes, interfaces, fields and methods to satisfy testable assertions.
</ul>


<!-- ====================== TERMINOLOGY ========================= -->

<a name="terminology"></a>
<h3>Terminology</h3>

A few terms have specific meanings within the context of Javadoc:

<dl>
<a name="generateddocument"></a>
  <dt><i>generated document</i>
    <dd>The document generated by the javadoc tool from the doc comments 
        in Java source code. The default generated document is in HTML
        and is created by the standard doclet.
<p>

<a name="name"></a>
  <dt><i>name</i>
    <dd>A name in the Java Language, namely the name of a package, class,
        interface, field, constructor or method.  A name can be fully-qualified,
        such as <code>java.lang.String.equals(java.lang.Object)</code>, or 
        partially-qualified, such as <code>equals(Object)</code>. 
<p>

<a name="documentedclasses"></a>
  <dt><i>documented classes</i>
    <dd>The classes and interfaces for which full documentation is generated 
        during a javadoc run.  To be documented, the source files must be 
        available, and either their source filenames or package names must 
        be passed into the javadoc command.
        We also refer to these as the classes included in the javadoc run, 
        or the <i>included classes</i>.
<p>

<a name="referencedclasses"></a>
  <dt><i>referenced classes</i>
    <dd>The classes and interfaces that are explicitly referred to in the 
        definition (implementation) of the documented classes and interfaces.  
        Examples of references include return type, parameter type, cast type, 
        extended class, implemented interface, imported classes, classes used 
        in method bodies, and so forth.   Classes referred to
        in doc comments (such as @see tags) do not qualify as referenced classes. 
        When Javadoc is run, it loads into memory all of the referenced 
        classes in javadoc's bootclasspath and classpath.  (Javadoc prints a 
        "Class not found" warning for referenced classes not found.)
        Javadoc can derive enough information from the the .class files
        to determine their existence and the fully-qualified names of their
        members.  
<p>

<a name="externalreferencedclasses"></a>
  <dt><i>external referenced classes</i>
    <dd>The referenced classes whose documentation is not being generated
        during a javadoc run.  In other words, these classes are external to 
        that javadoc run.  Links for names in the documentation to those 
        classes are said to be <i>external references</i> or <i>external links</i>.
        For example, if you run javadoc on only the 
        <code>java.awt</code> package, then any class in 
        <code>java.lang</code>, such as Object, is an external 
        referenced class.  External referenced classes can be linked to 
        using the <code>-link</code> option.  An important property of an
        external referenced class is that its source comments are not 
        available in the Javadoc run.  Therefore, these comments cannot be 
        <a href="#inheritingcomments">inherited</a>.
<p>

</dl>

</blockquote>

<br>
<!-- ====================== SOURCE FILES ========================= -->

<a name="sourcefiles"></a>
<h2>SOURCE FILES</h2>
<blockquote>

Javadoc will generate output originating from four different types of 
"source" files:  Java language source files for classes 
(<code>.java</code>), package comment files, overview comment files, 
and miscellaneous unprocessed files.  
<p>

<a name="javasourcefiles"></a>
<h3>Class Source Code Files</h3>

    Each class or interface and its members can have their own documentation
    comments, contained in a <code>.java</code> file.  For more details about
    these doc comments, see
    <a href="#documentationcomments">Documentation Comments</a>.

<a name="packagecomment"></a>
<h3>Package Comment Files</h3>

    Each package can have its own documentation comment, contained in its
    own "source" file, that Javadoc will merge into the package summary page 
    that it generates.  You typically include in this comment any 
    documentation that applies to the entire package.  
<p>
    To create a package comment file, you must name it 
    <b><code>package.html</code></b> and place it in the package 
    directory in the source tree along with the <code>.java</code> files.  
    Javadoc will automatically look for this filename in this location.
    Notice that the filename is identical for all packages.  
<p>
    The content of the package comment file is one big documentation
    comment, written in HTML, like all other comments, with one 
    exception:  The documentation comment should not include 
    the comment separators <code>/**</code> and 
    <code>*/</code> or leading asterisks.  When writing the comment,
    you should make the first sentence a summary about the package, 
    and not put a title or any other text between
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and the first sentence.
    You can include <a href="#packagetags">package tags</a>; as with any 
    documentation comment, all tags except <code>{@link}</code> must 
    appear after the description.  If you add a <code>@see</code> tag
    in a package comment file, it must have a fully-qualified name.
<p>
    When Javadoc runs, it will automatically look for 
    this file; if found, Javadoc does the following:

<ul>
   <li>Copies all content between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and 
      <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags for processing.

   <li>Processes any <a href="#packagetags">package tags</a> that are present.

   <li>Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the package summary page
    it generates, as shown in 
    <a href="../../api/java/applet/package-summary.html">Package Summary</a>.
    
   <li>Copies the first sentence of the package comment to the top of
    the package summary page.  It also adds the package name and this
    first sentence to the list of packages on the overview page, as shown in
    <a href="../../api/overview-summary.html">Overview Summary</a>.
    The end-of-sentence is determined by the same rules used 
    for the end of the first sentence of class and member descriptions.
</ul>

<a name="overviewcomment"></a>
<h3>Overview Comment File</h3>

    Each application or set of packages that you are documenting 
    can have its own overview documentation comment, kept in its 
    own "source" file, that Javadoc will merge into the overview page 
    that it generates.  You typically include in this comment any 
    documentation that applies to the entire application or set
    of packages.  
<p>
    To create an overview comment file, you can name the file anything
    you want, typically <b><code>overview.html</code></b> and place it 
    anywhere, typically at the top level of the source tree.
    Notice you can have multiple overview comment files for the same 
    set of source files, in case you want to run javadoc multiple 
    times on different sets of packages.  
    For example, if the source files for the <code>java.applet</code>
    package are contained in <code>C:\user\src\java\applet</code>
    directory, you could create an overview comment file at
    <code>C:\user\src\overview.html</code>.
<p>
    The content of the overview comment file is one big documentation
    comment, written in HTML, like the package comment file described
    previously.  See that description for details.  To re-iterate,
    when writing the comment, you should make the first sentence a 
    summary about the application or set of packages, and not put a 
    title or any other text between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and the
    first sentence.  You can include <a href="#overviewtags">overview 
    tags</a>; as with any documentation comment, all tags except in-line
    tags, such as <code>{@link}</code>, must appear after the description.  
    If you add a <code>@see</code> tag, it must have a fully-qualified
    name.
<p>
    When you run Javadoc, you specify the overview comment file name 
    with the <a href="#overview">-overview</a> option.  The file
    is then processed similar to that of a package comment file.
<p>

<ul>
   <li>Copies all content between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and 
      <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags for processing.

   <li>Processes any <a href="#overviewtags">overview tags</a> that are present.

   <li>Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the overview page
    it generates, as shown in 
    <a href="../../api/overview-summary.html">Overview Summary</a>.
    
   <li>Copies the first sentence of the overview comment to the top of
    the overview summary page.
</ul>
 
<a name="unprocessed"></a>
<h3>Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files</h3>

    You can also include in your source any miscellaneous files that
    you want Javadoc to copy to the destination directory.  These typically
    includes graphic files, example Java source (.java) and class (.class)
    files, and self-standing HTML files whose content would overwhelm 
    the documentation comment of a normal Java source file.
<p>
    To include unprocessed files, put them in a directory called
    <b><code>doc-files</code></b> which can be a subdirectory of any 
    package directory.  You can have one such subdirectory for each
    package.  You might include images, example code, source files, 
    .class files, applets and HTML files.  For example, if you want to 
    include the image of a button
    <code>button.gif</code> in the <code>java.awt.Button</code> 
    class documentation, you place that file in the
    <code>/home/user/src/java/awt/doc-files/</code> directory.

    All links to these unprocessed files must be hard-coded, because
    Javadoc does not look at the files -- it simply copies the directory
    and all its contents to the destination.   For example, the 
    link in the <code>Button.java</code> doc comment might look like:
<pre>
    /**
     * This button looks like this: 
     * &lt;img src="doc-files/Button.gif"&gt;
     */
</pre>

<br>
<!-- ====================== GENERATED FILES ========================= -->

<a name="generatedfiles"></a>
<h2>GENERATED FILES</h2>
<blockquote>

By default, javadoc uses a standard doclet that generates
HTML-formatted documentation.  This doclet generates the following kinds
of files (where each HTML "page" corresponds to a separate file).
Note that javadoc generates files with two types of names: those named 
after classes/interfaces, and those that are not (such as 
<code>package-summary.html</code>).  Files in the latter group contain 
hyphens to prevent filename conflicts with those in the former group.

<p>

<b>Basic Content Pages</b>
<ul>
  <li>One <b>class or interface page</b> (<i>classname</i><code>.html</code>) for each class or interface 
      it is documenting.  

<a name="package-summary.html"></a>
  <li>One <b>package page</b> (<code>package-summary.html</code>) for each 
      package it is documenting. Javadoc will include any HTML text 
      provided in a file named <code>package.html</code> in the 
      package directory of the source tree.

<a name="overview-summary.html"></a>
  <li>One <b>overview page</b> (<code>overview-summary.html</code>) for the entire 
      set of packages.  This is the front page of the generated document.  
      Javadoc will include any HTML text provided in a file specified with 
      the <a href="#overview"><code>-overview</code></a> option. 
      Note that this file is created only if you pass into javadoc
      two or more package names.  For further explanation, see 
      <a href="#htmlframes">HTML Frames</a>.)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Cross-Reference Pages</b>
<ul>
<a name="overview-tree.html"></a>
  <li>One <b>class hierarchy page for the entire set of packages</b> 
      (<code>overview-tree.html</code>).  To view this, click on "Overview" in 
      the navigation bar, then click on "Tree".
<a name="package-tree.html"></a>
  <li>One <b>class hierarchy page for each package</b> (<code>package-tree.html</code>)
      To view this, go to a particular package, class or interface page;  click 
      "Tree" to display the hierarchy for that package.
<a name="*-use.html"></a>
  <li>One <b>"use" page</b> for each package (<code>package-use.html</code>)
      and a separate one for each class and interface 
      (<code>class-use/</code><i>classname</i><code>.html</code>).  This page 
      describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields 
      use any part of the given class, interface or package. Given a class
      or interface A, its "use" page includes subclasses of A, fields declared as A, 
      methods that return A, and methods and constructors with parameters of 
      type A. You can access this page by first going to the package, class or 
      interface, then clicking on the "Use" link in the navigation bar.
<a name="deprecated-list.html"></a>
  <li>A <b>deprecated API page</b> (<code>deprecated-list.html</code>) listing 
      all deprecated names. (A deprecated name is not recommended for use, 
      generally due to improvements, and a replacement name is usually given. 
      Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.)
<a name="serialized-form.html"></a>
  <li>A <b>serialized form page</b> (<code>serialized-form.html</code>) for information 
      about serializable and externalizable classes. Each such class has a description 
      of its serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to 
      re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While there is no link in 
      the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any serialized 
      class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See also" section of the class
      description. The standard doclet automatically generates a 
      <a href="#serialized-form.html">serialized form page</a>: any class
      (public or non-public) that implements Serializable is included, along 
      with <code>readObject</code> and <code>writeObject</code> methods, the fields
      that are serialized, and the doc comments from the 
      <a href="#@serial"><code>@serial</code></a>, 
      <a href="#@serialField"><code>@serialField</code></a>, and 
      <a href="#@serial"><code>@serialData</code></a> tags.
      The standard doclet also produces links to the serialized form page
      as follows:  For each class that belongs to the serialize form, 
      a link "Serialized Form" is added on the class page under the 
      "See Also" heading.  This link is at the class (not member) level.
      Note that serialized classes can be either public or private.  To generate
      the complete serialized form for public and private classes, run javadoc
      with the <code>-private</code> option (we hope to eliminate this requirement
      in future a version).

<a name="index-*.html"></a>
  <li>An <b>index</b> (<code>index-*.html</code>) of all class, interface, constructor, 
      field and method names, alphabetically arranged.  This is internationalized 
      for Unicode and can be generated as a single file or as a separate file for 
      each starting character (such as A-Z for English).
</ul>
<p>
<b>Support Files</b>
<ul>
<a name="help-doc.html"></a>
  <li>A <b>help page</b> (<code>help-doc.html</code>) that describes the navigation 
      bar and the above pages.  You can provide your own custom help file to override 
      the default using <a href="#helpfile"><code>-helpfile</code></a>.
<a name="index.html"></a>
  <li>One <b>index.html file</b> which creates the HTML frames for display.  This is
      the file you load to display the front page with frames.  This file itself 
      contains no text content.
<a name="*-frame.html"></a>
  <li>Several <b>frame files</b>  (<code>*-frame.html</code>) containing lists of 
      packages, classes and interfaces, used when HTML frames are being displayed.
<a name="package-list"></a>
  <li>A <b>package list</b> file  (<code>package-list</code>), used by the 
      <code>-link</code> and <code>-linkoffline</code> 
      options. This is a text file, not HTML, and is not reachable through any 
      links.
<a name="stylesheet.css"></a>
  <li>A <b>style sheet</b> file (<code>stylesheet.css</code>) that controls
      a limited amount of color, font family, font size, font style and 
      positioning on the generated pages.
<a name="doc-files"></a>
  <li>A <b>doc-files</b> directory that holds any image, example, source code or
      other files that you want copied to the destination directory.  These
      files are not processed by Javadoc in any manner -- that is, any 
      javadoc tags in them will be ignored.  This directory is not generated
      unless it exists in the source tree.
</ul>

<p>


<a name="htmlframes"></a> 
<b>HTML Frames</b>
<p>

Javadoc will generate either two or three HTML frames, as shown in the 
figure below. When you pass source files (*.java) or a single package 
name as arguments into the javadoc command, it will create only one frame 
(C) in the left-hand column -- the list of classes.  
When you pass into javadoc two or more package names, it creates a third 
frame (P) listing all packages, as well as an overview page (Detail).  
This overview page has the filename <code>overview-summary.html</code>.
Thus, this file is created only if you pass in two or more package names.
You can bypass frames by clicking on the "No Frames" link or entering at 
overview-summary.html.
<p>
If you are unfamiliar with HTML frames, you should be aware that 
frames can have <i>focus</i> for printing and scrolling.  To give
a frame focus, click on it.  Then on many browsers the arrow keys
and page keys will scroll that frame, and the print menu command will 
print it.

<pre>
              ------------                  ------------
              |C| Detail |                  |P| Detail |
              | |        |                  | |        |
              | |        |                  |-|        |
              | |        |                  |C|        |

             javadoc *.java           javadoc java.lang java.awt
</pre>

Load one of the following two files as the starting page
depending on whether you want HTML frames or not:
<ul>
   <li><code>index.html</code> (for frames)
   <li><code>overview-summary.html</code> (for no frames)
</ul>


<a name="filestructure"></a>
<b>Generated File Structure</b>
<p>

The generated class and interface files are organized in the
same directory hierarchy that Java source files and class files
are organized.  This structure is one directory per subpackage.
<p>
For example, the document generated for the class 
<code>java.applet.Applet</code> class would be located at 
<code>java\applet\Applet.html</code>.  The file structure for
the java.applet package follows, given 
that the destination directory is named <code>apidocs</code>. 
All files that contain the word "frame" appear in the upper-left
or lower-left frames, as noted.  All other HTML files appear in the 
right-hand frame.
<p>
<blockquote>
    NOTE -  Directories are shown in <b>bold</b>.
    The asterisks (<code>*</code>) indicate the files
    and directories that are <i>omitted</i> when the arguments to 
    javadoc are source filenames (*.java) rather than package names. 
    Also when arguments are source filenames, <code>package-list</code> 
    is created but is empty.
    The doc-files directory will not be created in the destination 
    unless it exists in the source tree.

<!-- ================= API SIGNATURES ==================== -->
<a name="apisignatures"></a>
<h2>API SIGNATURES</h2>

<blockquote>
Javadoc generates a signature at the start of each class, interface, 
field, constructor, and method description.  This signature is the
declaration for that API item.  For example, the signature for the
<code>Boolean</code> class is:
<p>

<code>public final class Boolean<br>
extends Object<br>
implements Serializable
</code>
<p>

and the signature for the <code>Boolean.valueOf</code>method is:
<p>

<code>public static Boolean valueOf(String s)</code>
<p>

Javadoc can include the modifiers <code>public</code>, 
<code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>abstract</code>, 
<code>final</code>, <code>static</code>, <code>transient</code>, 
and <code>volatile</code>, but not <code>synchronized</code> or 
<code>native</code>.  These last two modifiers are considered 
implementation detail and not part of the API specification.
<p>

Rather than relying on the keyword <code>synchronized</code>,
APIs should document their concurrency semantics in the comment
description, as in "a single <code>Enumeration</code> cannot be used by 
multiple threads concurrently".  The document should not describe
how to achieve these semantics.  As another example, while 
<code>Hashtable</code> should be thread-safe, there's no 
reason to specify that we achieve this by synchronizing all 
of its exported methods.  We should reserve the right to synchronize 
internally at the bucket level, thus offering higher concurrency. 

</blockquote>


<!-- ================= DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS ==================== -->
<a name="documentationcomments"></a>
<h2>DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS</h2>

<blockquote>

<a name="comments"></a>
<h3>Commenting the Source Code</h3>

You can include documentation comments in the source code, ahead
of declarations for any entity (classes, interfaces, methods, constructors,
or fields).  These are also known as Javadoc comments.  
A doc comment consists of the characters between the characters
<code>/**</code> that begin the comment and the characters
<code>*/</code> that end it. The text can continue onto multiple lines. 
<p>
<pre>
/**
 * This is the typical format of a simple documentation comment.
 */
</pre>

To save space you can put a comment on one line:
<pre>
/** This comment takes up only one line. */
</pre>

<b>Placement of comments</b> - Documentation comments are recognized 
only when placed immediately before class, interface, constructor, 
method, or field declarations -- see the 
<a href="#classexample">class example</a>, 
<a href="#methodexample">method example</a>, and 
<a href="#fieldexample">field example</a>.
Documentation comments placed in the body of a method are ignored.  
Only one documentation comment per declaration statement is recognized 
by the Javadoc tool.  
<p>
A common mistake is to put an <code>import</code> statement between 
the class comment and the class declaration.  Avoid this, as Javadoc
will ignore the class comment.
<pre>
   /**
    * This is the class comment for the class Whatever.
    */

    import com.sun;   // MISTAKE - Important not to put import statement here

    public class Whatever {
    }
</pre>

<b>A comment is a description followed by tags</b> - The <em>description</em>
begins after the starting delimiter <code>/**</code> and continues
until the tag section.  The tag section starts with the first
character <code>@</code> that begins a line (ignoring leading asterisks,
white space and comment separator).  The description cannot continue 
after the tag section begins.  There can be any number of tags -- some 
types of tags can be repeated while others cannot.  This <code>@see</code> 
starts the tag section:
<p>
<pre>
/**
 * This is a doc comment.
 * @see java.lang.Object
 */
</pre>

<b>Standard and in-line tags</b> - A <em>tag</em> is a special keyword within 
a doc comment that Javadoc can process.  Javadoc has standard tags, which 
appear as <code>@tag</code>, and in-line tags, which appear within braces,
as <code>{@tag}</code>.  To be interpreted, a standard tag must appear 
at the beginning of a line, ignoring leading asterisks, white space 
and comment separator (<code>/**</code>).  This means you can use the 
<code>@</code> character elsewhere in the text and it will not be interpreted 
as the start of a tag.  If you want to start a line with the <code>@</code> character
and not have it be interpreted, use the HTML entity <code>&amp#064;</code>.
Each standard tag has associated text, which includes any text following the 
tag up to, but not including, either the next tag, or the end of the doc comment.  
An in-line tag is allowed and interpreted anywhere that text is allowed.  
The following example contains the standard tag <code>@deprecated</code> and 
in-line tag <code>{@link}</code>.
<p>
<pre>
/**
 * @deprecated  As of JDK 1.1, replaced by {@link #setBounds(int,int,int,int)}
 */
</pre>

<p>

<b>Comments are written in HTML</b> - The text must be written in HTML, 
in that they should use HTML entities and can use HTML tags. 
You can use whichever version of HTML your browser supports; 
we have written the standard doclet to generate 
HTML 3.2-compliant code elsewhere (outside of the documentation comments) 
with the inclusion of cascading style sheets and frames. 
(We preface each generated file with "HTML 4.0" because of the frame sets.)

<p>
For example, entities for the less-than
(<code>&lt;</code>) and greater-than (<code>&gt;</code>)
symbols should be written <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code>.
Likewise, the ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) should be written 
<code>&amp;amp;</code>.  The bold HTML tag <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is shown 
in the following example.
<p>
Here is a doc comment: 
<p>
<pre>
/**
 * This is a &lt;b&gt;doc&lt;/b&gt; comment.
 * @see java.lang.Object
 */
</pre>
<p>

<b>Leading asterisks</b> - When javadoc parses a doc comment, 
leading asterisk (<code>*</code>) 
characters on each line are discarded; blanks and tabs preceding 
the initial asterisk (<code>*</code>) characters 
are also discarded. If you omit the leading asterisk on a line, 
all leading white space is removed.  Therefore, you should not omit 
leading asterisks if you want leading white space to kept, such
as when indenting sample code with the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag.  
Without leading asterisks, the indents are lost in the 
generated documents, since the leading white space is removed.
<p>

<b>First sentence</b> - The first sentence of each doc comment 
should be a summary sentence, 
containing a concise but complete description of the declared entity. 
This sentence ends at the first period that is followed by a blank, 
tab, or line terminator, or at the first <a href="#javadoctags">tag</a>.
Javadoc copies this first sentence to the member summary 
at the top of the HTML page.
<p>

<b>Declaration with multiple fields</b> - Java allows declaring multiple 
fields in a single statement, but this statement can have only one 
documentation comment, which is copied for all fields. Therefore if you 
want individual documentation comments for each field, you must declare 
each field in a separate statement. For example, the following 
documentation comment doesn't make sense written as a single declaration
and would be better handled as two declarations:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/** 
 * The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y)
 */
public int x, y;      // Avoid this  
</pre>
</blockquote>

Javadoc generates the following documentation from the above code:

<blockquote>
<pre>
public int <b>x</b></pre>
<dl>
    <dd>The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y)
</dl>

<pre>
public int <b>y</b></pre>
<dl>
    <dd>The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y)
</dl>
</blockquote>

<b>Use header tags carefully</b> - When writing documentation
comments for members, it's best not to use HTML heading tags such 
as &lt;H1&gt; and &lt;H2&gt;, because Javadoc creates an entire 
structured document and these structural tags might interfere with 
the formatting of the generated document.  However, it is fine
to use these headings in class and package comments to provide 
your own structure.
<p>

<a name="inheritingcomments"></a>
<b>Automatic re-use of method comments</b> - Also known loosely as
"inheriting comments". If a method <code>m1()</code> in a class or 
interface has no doc comment or tags, Javadoc will instead use the 
comment and tags from method <code>m2()</code> it either overrides 
or implements, if any.  Method <code>m2()</code> must be a member
of a <a href="#documentedclasses">documented class</a>, and not an
<a href="#externalreferencedclasses">external referenced class</a>.
This occurs in three cases:
<ul>
  <li>When a method in a class overrides a method in a superclass
  <li>When a method in an interface overrides a method in a superinterface
  <li>When a method in a class implements a method in an interface
</ul>
<p>

In the first two cases, if a method <code>m()</code> overrides another method,
Javadoc will generate a subheading "Overrides" in the documentation
for <code>m()</code>, with a link to the method it is overriding.  
<p>

In the third case, if a method <code>m()</code> in a given class 
implements a method in an interface, Javadoc will generate a 
subheading "Specified by" in the documentation for <code>m()</code>, 
with a link to the method it is implementing.  
<p>

How does it search?  For a method in class C, Javdoc searches 
recursively through all interfaces that class C implements, 
then through all superclasses of C.  For a method in interface I, 
it searches recursively through all of its superinterfaces.  
In each case, it copies the first comment that it finds.
<p>

<b>Javadoc specification</b> - For the specification on documentation 
comments, see Chapter 18, Documentation Comments, in the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/index.html"><em>Java Language Specification</em></a>, 
by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele.

<!-- ====================== TAGS ========================= -->

<a name="javadoctags"></a>
<h2>JAVADOC TAGS</h2>

<blockquote>

Javadoc parses special tags when they are embedded
within a Java doc comment. These doc tags enable you to autogenerate a
complete, well-formatted API from your source code. The tags start
with an "at" sign (<code>@</code>) and are case-sensitive -- they must
be typed with the uppercase and lowercase letters as shown.
A tag must start at the beginning of a line (after any leading spaces
and an optional asterisk) or it is treated as normal text.  By convention, 
tags with the same name are grouped together.  For example, put all 
<code>@see</code> tags together.
<p>
For information about tags we might introduce in future releases, 
see <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/javadoc/proposed-tags.html">Proposed Tags</a>.

<dl>

<a name="@author"></a>
<dt><b><code>@author</code></b>&nbsp; <var>name-text</var>
<dd>Adds an "Author" entry with the specified <var>name-text</var>
to the generated docs when the -author option is used. 
A doc comment may contain multiple <code>@author</code> tags.
You can specify one name per <code>@author</code> tag or multiple
names per tag.  In the former case, Javadoc inserts a comma (<code>,</code>) 
and space between names.  In the latter case, the entire text is 
simply copied to the generated document without being parsed.
Therefore, use multiple names per line if you want a localized
name separator other than comma.
<p>

<a name="{@docRoot}"></a>
<dt><b><code>{@docRoot}</code></b>
<dd>Represents the relative path to the generated document's (destination)
root directory from any generated page.  It is useful when you want to 
include a file, such as a copyright page or company logo, that you want 
to reference from all generated pages.  Linking to the copyright page from
the bottom of each page is common.
<p>

This <code>{@docRoot}</code> tag can be used both on the command line 
and in a doc comment:
<p>
<ol>
  <li> On the command line, where the header/footer/bottom are defined:
<pre>
   javadoc -bottom '&lt;a href="{@docRoot}/copyright.html"&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;'
</pre>

  <li> In a doc comment:
<pre>
   /**
    * See the &lt;a href="{@docRoot}/copyright.html"&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;.
    */
</pre>

</ol>

The reason this tag is needed is because the generated docs
are in hierarchical directories, as deep as the number of subpackages.
This expression:
<pre>
  &lt;a href="{@docRoot}/copyright.html"&gt;
</pre>
would resolve to:
<pre>
  &lt;a href="../../copyright.html"&gt;      for java/lang/Object.java
</pre>
and
<pre>
  &lt;a href="../../../copyright.html"&gt;   for java/lang/ref/Reference.java
</pre>

<p>

<a name="@deprecated"></a>
<dt><b><code>@deprecated</code></b>&nbsp; <var>deprecated-text</var>
<dd>Adds a comment indicating that this API should no longer
be used (even though it may continue to work).  Javadoc moves the 
<var>deprecated-text</var> ahead of the description, placing it in italics 
and preceding it with a bold warning: "Deprecated". 
<p>

The first sentence of <var>deprecated-text</var> should at least tell the 
user when the API was deprecated and what to use as a replacement.  
Javadoc copies just the first sentence to the summary section and index.
Subsequent sentences can also explain why it has been deprecated. 
You should include a <code>{@link}</code> tag (for Javadoc 1.2 or 
later) that points to the replacement API:
<p>
<ul type=disc>

<li>For Javadoc 1.2 and later, use a <code>{@link}</code> tag.  This creates the link in-line, 
    where you want it. For example: 
<pre>
/**
 * @deprecated  As of JDK 1.1, replaced by {@link #setBounds(int,int,int,int)}
 */
</pre>

  <li>For Javadoc 1.1, the standard format is to create a <code>@see</code> tag
      (which cannot be in-line) for each <code>@deprecated</code> tag.
</ul>
<p>

For more about deprecation, see 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/misc/deprecation/index.html">The
@deprecated tag</a>. 
<p>


<a name="@exception"></a>
<dt><b><code>@exception</code></b>&nbsp; <var>class-name</var>&nbsp; <var>description</var>
<dd>The <code>@exception</code> tag is a synonym for <a href="#@throws"><code>@throws</code></a>.
<p>


<a name="{@link}"></a>
<dt><b><code>{@link</code></b>&nbsp; <var>package.class</var><code>#</code><var>member</var>&nbsp; <var>label</var><b><code>}</code></b>

<dd>Inserts an in-line link with visible text <i>label</i> that points 
to the documentation for the specified <a href="#name">name</a> in the Java Language 
that is <a href="#referencedclasses">referenced</a>.
This tag accepts exactly the same syntax for 
<a href="#package.class"><var>package.class</var><code>#</code><var>member</var></a>
and <var>label</var> as the <code>@see</code> tag, described below, 
but generates an in-line link rather than placing the link in the 
"See Also" section.   This tag begins and ends with curly braces 
to separate it from the rest of the in-line text.  If you need to 
use "}" inside the label, use the HTML entity notation &amp;#125;
<p>
There is no limit to the number of {@link} tags allowed in a sentence.
You can use this tag in the description part of a documentation comment 
or in the text portion of any tag (such as @deprecated, @return or @param).
<p>
For example, here is a comment that refers to the 
<code>getComponentAt(int, int)</code> method:

<pre>
Use the {@link #getComponentAt(int, int) getComponentAt} method.
</pre>

From this, the standard doclet would generate the following HTML (assuming it
refers to another class in the same package):

<pre>
Use the &lt;a href="Component.html#getComponentAt(int, int)"&gt;getComponentAt&lt;/a&gt; method.
</pre>

Which appears on the web page as:

<pre>
Use the <u>getComponentAt</u> method.
</pre>


<a name="@param"></a>
<dt><b><code>@param</code></b>&nbsp; <var>parameter-name</var><code> </code><var>description</var>
<dd>Adds a parameter to the "Parameters" section. The description may
be continued on the next line.
<p>

<a name="@return"></a>
<dt><b><code>@return</code></b>&nbsp; <var>description</var>
<dd>Adds a "Returns" section with the <var>description</var> text. 
This text should describe the return type and permissible range of values.
<p>

<a name="@see"></a>
<dt><b><code>@see</code></b>&nbsp; <var>reference</var>
<dd>Adds a "See Also" heading with a link or text entry that points to 
<var>reference</var>.  A doc comment may contain any number of 
<code>@see</code> tags, which are all grouped under the same heading.
The <code>@see</code> tag has three variations; the third form below 
is the most common.
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b><code>@see</code></b> <code>"</code><var>string</var>" &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b> Note - This form is broken in version 1.2 (prints none of the quoted text) 
but fixed in 1.2.2.  </b>

<dd>Adds a text entry for <var>string</var>.
    No link is generated. The <var>string</var> is a book or other reference 
    to information not available by URL.  Javadoc distinguishes
    this from the previous cases by looking for a double-quote (<code>"</code>) 
    as the first character. For example:
<pre>
     @see "The Java Programming Language"
</pre>
    This generates text such as:
<blockquote>
<dl>
     <dt><b>See Also:</b> 
        <dd>"The Java Programming Language"
</dl>

</blockquote>


<dt><b><code>@see</code></b> <code>&lt;a href="</code><var>URL#value</var><code>"&gt;</code><var>label</var><code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>
<dd>Adds a link as defined by <var>URL#value</var>.
    The <var>URL#value</var> is a relative or absolute URL. Javadoc distinguishes
    this from other cases by looking for a less-than symbol 
    (<code>&lt;</code>) as the first character.  For example:
<pre>
     @see &lt;a href="spec.html#section"&gt;Java Spec&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
    This generates a link such as:
<blockquote>
<dl>
     <dt><b>See Also:</b> 
        <dd><u>Java Spec</u>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<a name="package.class"></a>
<dt><b><code>@see</code></b>&nbsp; <var>package.class</var><code>#</code><var>member</var>&nbsp; <var>label</var>
<dd>Adds a link, with visible text <var>label</var>, that points to the documentation 
    for the specified <a href="#name">name</a> in the Java Language that is 
    <a href="#referencedclasses">referenced</a>.
    The <var>label</var> is optional; if omitted, the name appears instead
    as the visible text, suitably shortened -- see <a href="#shortened">How a name 
    is displayed</a>.  Use the label when you want the visible text to be abbreviated
    or different from the name.  
<p>
    In only version 1.2, just the name but not the label would automatically
    appear in &lt;code&gt; HTML tags, Starting with 1.2.2, the &lt;code&gt;
    is always included around the visible text, whether or not a label is used.
<p>

<a name="packageclassmember"><!-- --></a>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><b><var>package.class</var><code>#</code><var>member</var></b> is any valid
      <a href="#name">name</a> in the Java Language that is  
      <a href="#referencedclasses">referenced</a> -- a package, 
      class, interface, constructor, method or field name
      -- except that you replace the dot ahead of the member name
      with a hash character (<code>#</code>). If this name is in the documented 
      classes, Javadoc will
      automatically create a link to it.  To create links to 
      <a href="#externalreferencedclasses">external referenced
      classes</a>, use the <a href="#link"><code>-link</code></a> option.  
      Use either of the other two <code>@see</code> forms for referring 
      to documentation of a name that does not belong to a referenced class.
      This argument is described at greater length below under 
      <a href="#specifyingname">Specifying a Name</a>.
<p>

  <li><b><var>label</var></b> is optional text that is visible as the link's 
      label.  The <var>label</var> can contain whitespace.  If <var>label</var> 
      is omitted, then <i>package.class.member</i>
      will appear, suitably shortened relative to the current class and package -- 
      see <a href="#shortened">How a name is displayed</a>.
<p>

  <li>A space is the delimiter between
      <var>package.class</var><code>#</code><var>member</var> and <var>label</var>.  
      A space inside parentheses does not indicate the start of a label, so spaces 
      may be used between parameters in a method.
<p>
</ul>
<p>

<b>Example</b> - In this example, an <code>@see</code> tag (in the <code>Character</code> 
class) refers to the <code>equals</code> method in the <code>String</code> class.  
The tag includes both arguments: the name "<code>String#equals(Object)</code>" 
and the label "<code>equals</code>".  

<blockquote>
<pre>
 /**
  * @see String#equals(Object) equals
  */
</pre>
</blockquote>

The standard doclet produces HTML something like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;See Also:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="../../java/lang/String#equals(java.lang.Object)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;equals&lt;code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

Which looks something like this in a browser, where the label is the visible link text:
<blockquote>
<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>See Also:</b>
<dd><u>equals</u>
</dl>

</blockquote>

<a name="specifyingname"></a>
<p>
      <b>Specifying a name</b> - This 
      <var>package.class</var><code>#</code><var>member</var>
      name can be either fully-qualified, such as
      <code>java.lang.String#toUpperCase()</code> or not, 
      such as <code>String#toUpperCase()</code> or <code>#toUpperCase()</code>. 
      If less than fully-qualified, Javadoc uses the 
      normal Java compiler search order to find it, further 
      described below in <a href="#seesearchorder">Search order for @see</a>.  
      The name can contain whitespace within parentheses, such as 
      between method arguments.  
<p>

      Of course the advantage to providing shorter, "partially-qualified" names
      is that they are less to type and less clutter in the source code.
      The following table shows the different forms of the name, where <var>Class</var> 
      can be a class or interface, <var>Type</var> can be a class, interface, 
      array, or primitive, and <var>method</var> can be a method or constructor.

<p>

The following notes apply to the above table:
<p>
<ul type=circle>
  <li>The first set of forms (with no class or package) will cause Javadoc to
      search only through the current class's hierarchy.  It will  
      find a member of the current class or interface, one of its
      superclasses or superinterfaces, or one of its enclosing classes 
      or interfaces (<a href="#seesearchorder">search steps 1-3</a>).
      It will not search the rest of the current package or other packages
      (search steps 4-5).
  <li>If any method or constructor is entered as a name with no parentheses, 
      such as <code>getValue</code>, and if there is no field with the same name, 
      Javadoc will correctly create a link to it, but will print 
      a warning message reminding you to add the parentheses and arguments.
      If this method is overloaded, Javadoc will link to the first method
      its search encounters, which is unspecified.
  <li>Inner classes must be specified as 
      <var>outer</var><code>.</code><var>inner</var>,
      not simply <var>inner</var>, for all forms.
  <li>As stated, the hash character (<code>#</code>), rather than a dot 
      (<code>.</code>) separates a member from its class.  This enables Javadoc 
      to resolve ambiguities, since the dot also separates classes, inner classes, 
      packages, and subpackages.  However, Javadoc is generally lenient and 
      will properly parse a dot if you know there is no ambiguity, though it will 
      print a warning.
</ul>
<p>


<a name="seesearchorder"></a>
<b>Search order for @see</b> - Javadoc will process a 
<code>@see</code> tag that appears in a source file (.java), 
package file (package.html) or overview file (overview.html).
In the latter two files, you must fully-qualify the name
you supply with <code>@see</code>.  In a source file, you can 
specify a name that is fully-qualified or partially-qualified.  
<p>

When Javadoc encounters a <code>@see</code> tag in a 
<code>.java</code> file that is <i>not</i> fully qualified,  it 
searches for the specified name in the same order as the Java 
compiler would (except Javadoc will not detect certain namespace 
ambiguities, since it assumes the source code is free of these 
errors). This search order is formally defined in Chapter 6, "Names" 
of the <i>Java Language Specification</i>, modified by the Inner 
Classes Specification.  Javadoc 
searches for that name through all related 
and imported classes and packages.  In particular, it searches in this order:
<p>

<ol>
  <li>the current class or interface
  <li>any enclosing classes and interfaces, searching closest first
  <li>any superclasses and superinterfaces, searching closest first
  <li>the current package
  <li>any imported packages, classes and interfaces, searching
      in the order of the import statement
</ol>
<p>

Javadoc continues to search recursively through steps 1-3
for each class it encounters until it finds a match.  That is, after 
it searches through the current class and its enclosing class E, 
it will search through E's superclasses before E's enclosing classes.

<!-- The order of steps 2 and 3 above don't matter.
A compiler error occurs if a member is both in an enclosing class
and a superclass, according to Atul. -->

In steps 4 and 5, Javadoc does not search classes or interfaces
within a package in any specified order (that order depends on 
the particular compiler).  In step 5, Javadoc will look in 
java.lang, since that is automatically imported by all programs.
<p>

Javadoc won't necessarily look in subclasses, nor will it look 
in other packages even if their documentation is being generated 
in the same run.  For example, if the <code>@see</code> tag is 
in <code>java.awt.event.KeyEvent</code> class and refers to a name 
in the <code>java.awt</code> package, javadoc will not look in that 
package unless that class imports it.
<p>

<a name="shortened"></a>
<b>How a name is displayed</b> -
If <var>label</var> is omitted, then <i>package.class.member</i>
will appear.  In general, it will be suitably 
shortened relative to the current class and package.  
By "shortened", we mean Javadoc will display
only the minimum name necessary.  For example, if the 
<code>String.toUpperCase()</code> method contains references
to a member of the same class and to a member of a different
class, the class name will be displayed only in the latter case:

<a name="@since"></a>
<dt><b><code>@since</code></b>&nbsp; <var>since-text</var>
<dd>Adds a "Since" heading with the specified <var>since-text</var>
to the generated documentation. The text has no special internal structure.
This tag means that this change or feature has existed since the 
software release specified by the <var>since-text</var>. For example:
<pre>    @since 1.3
</pre>
<p>



<a name="@serial"></a>
<dt><b><code>@serial</code></b>&nbsp; <var>field-description</var>
 <dd>Used in the doc comment for a default serializable field.
<p>          

     An optional <var>field-description</var> should explain the meaning 
     of the field and list the acceptable values. If needed, the description 
     can span multiple lines.  The standard doclet adds this information to 
     the <a href="#serialized-form.html">serialized form page</a>.
<p>          
 
     The <code>@since</code> tag should be added to each serializable 
     field that has been added since the initial version of a 
     <code>Serializable</code> class.
<p>

     For more information about how to use these tags, along with an example, 
     see
     "<a href="../../guide/serialization/spec/serial-arch.doc6.html">Documenting 
     Serializable Fields and Data for a Class</a>,"
     Section 1.6 of the <em>Java Object Serialization Specification</em>.
     Also see the
     <a href="/products/jdk/serialization/faq/#javadoc_warn_missing">
     Serialization FAQ</a>, which covers the questions "Why does the 
     javadoc standard doclet generate many warnings about missing 
     @serial and/or @serialData tags?" and "Why do I see javadoc warnings
     stating that I am missing @serial tags for private fields if I am not 
     running javadoc with the -private switch?".
<p>

<a name="@serialField"></a>
<dt><b><code>@serialField</code></b>&nbsp; <var>field-name</var>&nbsp; <var>field-type</var>&nbsp; <var>field-description</var> 
 <dd>Documents an <code>ObjectStreamField</code> component of a 
     <code>Serializable</code> class' <code>serialPersistentFields</code> 
     member. One <code>@serialField</code> tag should be used for 
     each <code>ObjectStreamField</code> component. 
<p>

<a name="@serialData"></a>
<dt><b><code>@serialData</code></b>&nbsp; <var>data-description</var>
 <dd>The <var>data-description</var> documents the types and order of data
     in the serialized form.  Specifically, this data includes 
     the optional data written by the <code>writeObject</code>
     method and all data (including base classes) written by the 
     <code>Externalizable.writeExternal</code> method.
<p>
     
     The <code>@serialData</code> tag can be used in the doc comment
     for the <code>writeObject</code>, <code>readObject</code>, 
     <code>writeExternal</code>, and <code>readExternal</code> methods.
<p>

<a name="@throws"></a>
<dt><b><code>@throws</code></b>&nbsp; <var>class-name</var>&nbsp; <var>description</var>
<dd>The <code>@throws</code> and <code>@exception</code> tags are synonyms.
Adds a "Throws" subheading to the generated documentation, with 
the <var>class-name</var> and <var>description</var> text.  
The <var>class-name</var> is the name of the exception that may 
be thrown by the method. If this class is not fully-specified, 
Javadoc uses the <a href="#seesearchorder">search order</a> to 
look up this class.
<p>

<a name="@version"></a>
<dt><b><code>@version</code></b>&nbsp; <var>version-text</var>
<dd>Adds a "Version" subheading with the specified <var>version-text</var>
to the generated docs when the -version option is used. The text 
has no special internal structure. A doc comment may contain at most 
one <code>@version</code> tag.  Version normally refers to the version 
of the software (such as the Java 2 SDK) that contains this class or member.

<!-- ============== COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILE ======================= -->

<a name="argumentfile"></a>
<h2>COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILE</h2>

<blockquote>
To shorten or simplify the <code>javadoc</code> command, you may specify
one or more files that themselves contain one source filename or package 
name per line.  When executing javadoc, pass in the filename with the 
'<tt>@</tt>' leading character to specify it as a file list.  When javadoc 
encounters an argument beginning with the character `<tt>@</tt>', it operates 
on the names in that file as if they were on the command line.  
<p>

For example, you can list all of the package names in a file
named <code>packages</code>.  This file might look like:
<p>

<pre>
     com.mypackage1
     com.mypackage2
     com.mypackage3
</pre>

You could then run javadoc with:
<pre>
     C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d apidocs @packages</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<!-- PERHAPS FORMALIZE SOMEDAY:
<blockquote>
To shorten or simplify the <code>javadoc</code> command, you may specify
one or more files that themselves contain one argument

the filename to specify it as a file list.  When javadoc encounters 
an argument beginning with the character `<tt>@</tt>', it operates

<p>

This file can have one or more arguments per line.  The arguments in 
this file are inserted into the command line at the position 
of the <code>@</code><i>filename</i> argument.
This enables you to create javadoc commands of any length. 
For example, here are four typical ways you might use the argument 
file: For all arguments, for only the options, for only the 
packages/classes, or separate files for the options and packages:
<pre>
     javadoc @args

     javadoc @options java.awt java.awt.event

     javadoc -d C:\home\html @packages

     javadoc @options @packages

The javadoc tool uses <a href="#doclets">doclets</a> to 
determine its output. Javadoc uses the default standard doclet
unless a custom doclet is specified with the -doclet option.
Javadoc provides a set of command-line 
options that can be used with any doclet -- these options are described 
below under the sub-heading <a href="#javadocflags">Javadoc Options</a>. 
The standard doclet provides an additional set of command-line options 
that are described below under the sub-heading 
<a href="#standard">Options Provided by the Standard Doclet</a>.
All option names are case-insensitive, though their arguments can be
case-sensitive.

<!-- ============== JAVADOC OPTIONS ======================= -->

<a name="javadocflags"><!-- --></a> 
<p>
<a name="javadocoptions"></a>
<h3>Javadoc Options</h3>

<dl>

<a name="overview"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-overview</b> &nbsp;<i>path\filename</i>
<dd>
Specifies that javadoc should retrieve the text for the overview
documentation from the "source" file specified by <i>path\filename</i>
and place it on the Overview page
(<code>overview-summary.html</code>).  The <i>path\filename</i> is
relative to the <code>-sourcepath</code>.
<p>
While you can use any name you want for <i>filename</i> and place it
anywhere you want for <i>path</i>, a typical thing to do is to name it
<code>overview.html</code> and place it in the source tree at the
directory that contains the topmost package directories.  In this
location, no <i>path</i> is needed when documenting packages, since
<code>-sourcepath</code> will point to this file.  For example, if the
source tree for the <code>java.lang</code> package is
<code>C:\src\classes\java\lang\</code>, then you could place the
overview file at <code>C:\src\classes\overview.html</code>.
See <a href="#realworldexample">Real World Example</a>.
<p>
For information about the file specified by <i>path\filename</i>, see 
<a href="#overviewcomment">overview comment file</a>.
<p>
Note that the overview page is created only if you pass into javadoc
two or more package names.  For further explanation, see 
<a href="#htmlframes">HTML Frames</a>.)
<p>

<a name="public"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-public</b>
<dd>
Shows only public classes and members.
<p>

<a name="protected"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-protected</b>
<dd>
Shows only protected and public classes and members. This is the default.
<p>

<a name="package"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-package</b>
<dd>
Shows only package, protected, and public classes and members.
<p>

<a name="private"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-private</b>
<dd>
Shows all classes and members.
<p>

<a name="help"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-help</b>
<dd>
Displays the online help, which lists these javadoc and doclet 
command line options.
<p>

<a name="doclet"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-doclet</b>&nbsp; <var>class</var>
<dd>
Specifies the class file that starts the doclet used in generating the
documentation.  This doclet defines the content and formats the
output.  If the <b><code>-doclet</code></b> option is not used,
javadoc uses the standard doclet for generating the default HTML
format. This class must contain the <code>start(Root)</code> method.
The path to this starting class is defined by the
<code>-docletpath</code> option.
<p>

<a name="docletpath"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-docletpath</b>&nbsp; <var>classpathlist</var>
<dd>
Specifies the path to the doclet class file that is specified with the 
<code>-doclet</code> option.  The <var>classpathlist</var> can contain
multiple paths, which should be separated with a colon (:) on Solaris
and a semi-colon (;) on Windows.  This option is not necessary if the 
doclet is already in the search path.
<p>

<a name="1.1"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-1.1</b>
<dd>
Generates the documentation with the appearance and functionality
of documentation generated by Javadoc 1.1.  That is, 
the pages have a gray background, use images for headers, 
have bulleted lists instead of tables, have a flat destination 
directory structure, do not contain inherited API, 
do not use HTML frames, and do not support inner classes.  
This option also automatically splits the index into a separate
file for each letter of the alphabet.
If you want this appearance, this option has the advantage over 
javadoc 1.1 of having some bugs fixed.
<p>
Not all options work with the <code>-1.1</code> option.  To find out
which other options are available, execute:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -1.1 -help</b>
</pre>
The <code>-footer</code> option shown in this list is functionally the same 
as the <code>-bottom</code> option described elsewhere on this page.  The 
<code>-title</code> option is functionally the same as <code>-doctitle</code>.
<p>

<a name="sourcepath"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-sourcepath</b>&nbsp; <var>sourcepathlist</var>
<dd>

Specifies the search paths for finding source files (<code>.java</code>) 
when passing package names into the <code>javadoc</code> command.  
Note that you can use the <code>-sourcepath</code> option only when passing 
package names into the javadoc command -- it will not locate
<code>.java</code> files passed into the <code>javadoc</code> command. 
(To locate <code>.java</code> files, cd to that directory or include the 
path ahead of each file, as shown at <a href="#documentingclasses">Documenting 
One or More Classes</a>.)
If <code>-sourcepath</code> is omitted, javadoc uses the class path to
find the source files (see -<a href="#classpath">classpath</a>).  
Therefore, the default -sourcepath is the value of class path.
If -classpath is omitted and you are passing package names into javadoc,
it looks in the current directory (and subdirectories) for the source files.
<p>

Set <var>sourcepathlist</var> to the root directory of the source tree 
for the package you are documenting.  For example, 
suppose you want to document a package called <code>com.mypackage</code> 
whose source files are located at:
<pre>
C:\user\src\com\mypackage\*.java
</pre>
In this case you would specify the <code>sourcepath</code> to 
<code>C:\user\src</code>, the directory that contains 
<code>com\mypackage</code>, and then supply the package name 
<code>com.mypackage</code>:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -sourcepath C:\user\src com.mypackage</b>
</pre>

This is easy to remember by noticing that if you concatenate 
the value of sourcepath and the package name together and 
change the dot to a backslash "\", you end up with the full path 
to the package: <code>C:\user\src\com\mypackage</code>.
<p>


<a name="classpath"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-classpath</b>&nbsp; <var>classpathlist</var>
<dd>
Specifies the paths where javadoc will look for 
<a href="#referencedclasses">referenced classes</a> (<code>.class</code>) 
-- these are the documented classes plus any classes referenced by those 
classes.  Javadoc will search in all subdirectories of the specified paths.  
The <i>classpathlist</i> can contain multiple paths by separating them 
with a semicolon.  Follow the instructions in 
<a href="classpath.html">class path</a> documentation for specifying 
<var>classpathlist</var>.
<p>

If <code>-sourcepath</code> is omitted, Javadoc uses 
<code>-classpath</code> to find the source files as well as 
class files (for backward compatibility).  Therefore, if you want
to search for source and class files in separate paths, use both
<code>-sourcepath</code> and <code>-classpath</code>.
<p>

For example, if you want to document <code>com.mypackage</code>, whose 
source files reside in the directory <code>C:\user\src\com\mypackage</code>, 
and if this package relies on a library in <code>C:\user\lib</code>, 
you would specify:

<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -classpath \user\lib -sourcepath \user\src com.mypackage</b>
</pre>

As with other tools, if you do not specify <code>-classpath</code>, 
Javadoc uses the CLASSPATH environment variable, if it is set.  
If both are not set, Javadoc searches for classes from the current 
directory.
<p>

For an in-depth description of how Javadoc uses <code>-classpath</code> to 
find user classes as it relates to extension classes and bootstrap classes, 
see <a href="../findingclasses.html">How Classes Are Found</a>.
<p>


<a name="bootclasspath"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-bootclasspath</b>&nbsp; <var>classpathlist</var>
<dd>
Specifies the paths where the boot classes reside.  These are nominally
the Java platform classes.  The bootclasspath is part of the search path 
Javadoc will use to look up source and class files.  See
<a href="../findingclasses.html#srcfiles">How Classes Are Found</a>.
for more details.  Separate directories in <var>classpathlist</var> with 
semicolons (;).
<p>

<a name="extdirs"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-extdirs</b>&nbsp; <var>dirlist</var>
<dd>
Specifies the directories where extension classes reside.  These are any classes 
that use the Java Extension mechanism.  The extdirs is part of the search path 
Javadoc will use to look up source and class files.  See <code>-classpath</code> 
(above) for more details.  Separate directories in <var>dirlist</var> with 
semicolons (;).
<p>

<a name="verbose"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-verbose</b>
<dd>
Provides more detailed messages while javadoc is running.
Without the verbose option, messages appear for loading the source files, 
generating the documentation (one message per source file), and sorting. 
The verbose option causes the printing of additional messages specifying 
the number of milliseconds to parse each java source file. 
<p>

<a name="locale"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-locale</b>&nbsp; <i>language_country_variant</i>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<B>Important</B> - The <code>-locale</code> option must be placed
<i>ahead</i> (to the left) of any <a href="#standard">options provided by 
the standard doclet</a> or any other doclet.  Otherwise, the navigation 
bars will appear in English.  This is the only command-line option that 
is order-dependent.
</blockquote>
Specifies the locale that javadoc uses when generating documentation.
The argument is the name of the locale, as described in java.util.Locale
documentation, such as <code>en_US</code> (English, United States) 
or <code>en_US_WIN</code> (Windows variant).
<p>
Specifying a locale causes javadoc to choose the resource files of that locale
for messages (strings in the navigation bar, headings for lists and tables,
help file contents, comments in stylesheet.css, and so forth).  It also specifies
the sorting order for lists sorted alphabetically, and the sentence separator
to determine the end of the first sentence.  It does not determine the
locale of the doc comment text specified in the source files of the documented
classes.
<p>

<a name="encoding"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-encoding</b>&nbsp; <i>name</i>
<dd>
Specifies the source file encoding name, such as <code>EUCJIS/SJIS</code>. If 
this option is not specified, the platform default converter is used.
<p>

<a name="J"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-J</b><i>flag</i>
<dd>
Passes <i>flag</i> directly to the runtime system 
<a href="java.html#options">java</a> that runs javadoc.
Notice there must be no space between the <code>J</code> and the <i>flag</i>.
For example, if you need to ensure that the system sets aside 32 megabytes 
of memory in which to process the generated documentation, then you would 
call the <a href="java.html#Xms"><code>-Xmx</code></a> option of java as follows
(<code>-Xms</code> is optional, as it only sets the size of initial memory,
which is useful if you know the minimum amount of memory required):
<pre>
   C:&gt; <b>javadoc -J-Xmx32m -J-Xms32m</b> <b>com.mypackage</b>
</pre>
To tell what version of javadoc you are using, call the 
"<code>-version</code>" option of java: 
<p>
<pre>
   C:&gt; <b>javadoc -J-version</b>
   java version "1.2"
   Classic VM (build JDK-1.2-V, green threads, sunwjit)
</pre>
</dl>

<!-- ============== STANDARD OPTIONS ======================= -->


<a name="standard"><!-- --></a>
<h3>Options Provided by the Standard Doclet</h3>
<dl>

<a name="d"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-d</b>&nbsp; <var>directory</var>
<dd>
Specifies the destination directory where javadoc saves the 
generated HTML files. (The "d" means "destination.") Omitting this
option causes the files to be saved to the current directory.  
The value <var>directory</var> can be 
absolute or relative to the current working directory.  
For example, the following generates the documentation for the <code>com.mypackage</code>
package and saves the results in the <code>C:\user\doc\</code> directory:

<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d \user\doc com.mypackage</b>
</pre>
<p>

<a name="use"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-use</b>
<dd>
Includes one "Use" page for each documented class and package.  The page
describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use any 
API of the given class or package.  Given class C, things that use 
class C would include subclasses of C, fields declared as C, methods 
that return C, and methods and constructors with parameters of type C. 
<p>
For example, let's look at what might appear on the "Use" page for
String.  The <code>getName()</code> method in the 
<code>java.awt.Font</code> class returns type <code>String</code>.  
Therefore, <code>getName()</code> uses <code>String</code>, and 
you will find that method on the "Use" page for <code>String</code>.
<p>
Note that this documents only uses of the API, not the implementation.
If a method uses <code>String</code> in its implementation but does not
take a string as an argument or return a string, that is not considered 
a "use" of <code>String</code>.
<p>
You can access the generated "Use" page by first going to the class or package, 
then clicking on the "Use" link in the navigation bar.

<a name="version"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-version</b>
<dd>
Includes the @version text in the generated docs. 
This text is omitted by default.
To tell what version of Javadoc you are using, use the 
<code><a href="#J">-J-version</a></code> option.
<p>

<a name="author"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-author</b>
<dd>
Includes the @author text in the generated docs. 
<p>

<a name="splitindex"></a>
<dt><b>-splitindex</b>
<dd>
Splits the index file into multiple files, alphabetically, one file 
per letter, plus a file for any index entries that start with 
non-alphabetical characters.
<p>

<a name="windowtitle"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-windowtitle</b>&nbsp; <i>title</i>
<dd>
Specifies the title to be placed in the HTML &lt;title&gt; tag.
This appears in the window title and in any browser bookmarks (favorite places) 
that someone creates for this page. This title should not contain
any HTML tags, as the browser will not properly interpret them.
Any internal quotation marks within <i>title</i> may have to be escaped.  
If -windowtitle is omitted, Javadoc uses the value of -doctitle for this option.
<p>
<PRE>
  C:&gt; <B>javadoc -windowtitle "Java&nbsp;2 Platform" com.mypackage</B>
</PRE>

<a name="doctitle"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-doctitle</b>&nbsp; <i>title</i> 
<dd>
Specifies the title to be placed near the top of the overview summary file. 
The title will be placed as a centered, level-one heading directly 
beneath the upper navigation bar. The <i>title</i> may contain 
html tags and white space, though if it does, it must be enclosed 
in quotes.  Any internal quotation marks within <i>title</i> 
may have to be escaped.  
<p>
<PRE>
  C:&gt; <B>javadoc -doctitle "Java&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\"&gt;TM&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;" com.mypackage</B>
</PRE>

<a name="title"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-title</b>&nbsp; <i>title</i> 
<dd>
<b>This option no longer exists.</b>  It existed only in Beta versions
of Javadoc 1.2.  It has been renamed to <b>-doctitle</b>.
This option is being renamed to make it clear that it defines the 
document title rather than the window title.
<p>

<a name="header"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-header</b>&nbsp; <i>header</i>
<dd>
Specifies the header text to be placed at the top of each output file. 
The header will be placed to the right of the upper navigation bar. 
<i>header</i> may contain HTML tags and white space, though if it does, 
it must be enclosed in quotes. Any internal quotation marks within 
<i>header</i> may have to be escaped. 
<p>
<PRE>
  C:&gt; <B>javadoc -header "&lt;b&gt;Java&nbsp;2 Platform&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;v1.3" com.mypackage</B>
</PRE>
<p>

<a name="footer"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-footer</b>&nbsp; <i>footer</i>
<dd>
Specifies the footer text to be placed at the bottom of each output file. 
The footer will be placed to the right of the lower navigation bar. 
<i>footer</i> may contain html tags and white space, though if it does, 
it must be enclosed in quotes. Any internal quotation marks within 
<i>footer</i> may have to be escaped.
<p>

<a name="bottom"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-bottom</b>&nbsp; <i>text</i>
<dd>
Specifies the text to be placed at the bottom of each output file. The 
text will be placed at the bottom of the page, below the lower  
navigation bar. The <var>text</var> may contain 
HTML tags and white space, though if it does, it must be enclosed 
in quotes.  Any internal quotation marks within <var>text</var> 
may have to be escaped.  
<p>

<a name="link"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-link</b>&nbsp; <i>extdocURL</i> <br>

<dd>
Creates links to already existing javadoc-generated documentation of 
<a href="#referencedclasses">external referenced classes</a>. The
argument <i>extdocURL</i> is the URL for the external documentation 
you want to link to.  You can supply either an absolute URL or
a relative URL -- the latter should be relative to the destination 
directory (specified with <code>-d</code>).
<p>

In other words, this option enables you to link to classes referenced 
to by your code but <em>not</em> being documented in the current javadoc 
run.  For these links to go to valid pages, you must know where those 
HTML pages are located, and specify that location with <i>extdocURL</i>.
This allows, for instance, third party documentation to link 
to <code>java.*</code> documentation on <code>http://java.sun.com</code>.  
Another use is to for <a href="#cross-links">cross-links</a> between
sets of packages:  Execute javadoc on one set of packages, 
then run javadoc again on another set of packages, creating 
links both ways between both sets.  A third 
use is as a "hack" to <a href="#update">update docs</a>:  
Execute javadoc on a full set of packages, then run javadoc again 
on only the smaller set of changed packages, so that the updated 
files can be inserted back into the original set. (This is
done to save time, but can be tricky -- if you add or remove API 
from the subset, there will be missing or broken links in the index.)
<p>

Use the <code>-link</code> option as follows:
<p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Omit the <code>-link</code> option for javadoc to create links only to 
      API within the documentation it is generating in 
      the current run. (Without the <code>-link</code> option, Javadoc 
      does not create links to documentation for external references, 
      because it does not know if (or where) that documentation exists.)
<p>

  <li>Include the <code>-link</code> option for javadoc to also create links 
      to documentation at location <i>extdocURL</i> for
      <a href="#extrefclass">external referenced classes</a>.
</ul>
<p>

Note that if the URL is on the World Wide Web, javadoc must have a web connection
in order to access the <code>package-list</code> when generating the documentation.  
If you do not have access, use <code>-linkoffline</code> instead.
<p>

<b>Package List</b> - The <code>-link</code> option requires that a file named 
<code>package-list</code>, which is generated by Javadoc, exist at the URL you 
specify with <code>-link</code>.  The <code>package-list</code> file is a 
simple text file that lists the names of packages documented at that location.
How Javadoc uses the package list is described below.
<p>

For example, the package list for the Java 2 Platform v1.3 API is located at
<code><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/package-list">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/package-list</a></code>.
and starts out as follows:
<pre>
  java.applet  
  java.awt
  java.awt.color
  java.awt.datatransfer
  java.awt.dnd
  java.awt.event
  java.awt.font
  etc.
</pre>
<p>

When javadoc is run without the <code>-link</code> option, as it is generating
documentation, when it encounters a name that belongs to an 
<a href="#externalreferencedclasses">external referenced class</a>, 
it prints the name with no link. However, when the <code>-link</code> 
option is used, Javadoc searches the <code>package-list</code> 
file at the specified <i>extdocURL</i> location for that package name.  
If it finds the package name, it prefixes the name with that URL.
<p>

In order for there to be no broken links, all of the documentation for the
external references must exist at the specified URLs.  Javadoc will not check
that these pages exist -- only that the package-list exists.  
<p>

The <code>package-list</code> file is created but is empty if the argument 
to javadoc is source files rather than packages. 
<p>

<b>Example</b> -
For example, the following command causes Javadoc to look for a 
<code>package-list</code> file at the given URL, reads in the package
names in that file, and then uses the given URL when adding links
to API in those external packages:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -link http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api com.mypackage</b>
</pre>

<b>Multiple Links</b> - You can supply multiple <code>-link</code> options to 
link to any number of external generated documents. &nbsp; 
<em><b>Known Bug</b> - Javadoc 1.2 has 
a known bug which prevents you from supplying more than one</em> 
-link <em>command.  This is fixed in 1.2.2.</em>
<p>

Specify a different link option for each external document to link to:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> C:&gt; <b>javadoc -link</b> </code><i>extdocURL1</i><code> <b>-link</b> </code><i>extdocURL2</i><code> ... <b>-link</b> </code><i>extdocURLn</i><code> <b>com.mypackage</b></code>
<p>

where <i>extdocURL1</i>,&nbsp; <i>extdocURL2</i>,&nbsp; ... <i>extdocURLn</i> point 
respectively to the roots of external documents, each of which 
contains a file named <code>package-list</code>. 
<p>

<a name="cross-links"></a>
<b>Cross-links</b> - Note that "bootstrapping" may be required when cross-linking 
two or more documents that have not previously been generated.  In other words, 
if <code>package-list</code> does not exist for either document, when you run javadoc
on the first document, the <code>package-list</code> will not yet exist for the 
second document.  Therefore, to create the external links, you must re-generate 
the first document after generating the second document.
<p>

In this case, the purpose of first generating a document is to create its 
<code>package-list</code> (or you can create it by hand it if you're 
certain of the package names).  Then generate the second document with its 
external links.  Javadoc prints a warning if a needed external 
<code>package-list</code> file does not exist.
<p>

<a name="update"></a>
<b>Updating docs</b> - The third use for <code>-link</code> option is useful 
if your project has dozens or hundreds of packages, if you have already run 
javadoc on the entire tree, and now, in a separate run, you want to quickly 
make some small changes and re-run javadoc on just a small portion of the 
source tree.  This is somewhat of a hack in that it works properly only if 
your changes are only to doc comments and not to signatures.  If you were 
to add, remove or change any signatures from the source code, then 
broken links could show up in the index, package tree, inherited member lists,
use page, or other places.
<p>

First, you create a new destination directory for this new small run and 
set <code>-link</code> and <code>-d</code> to that same relative path:
If the original docs are in a directory named <code>html</code>:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d update -link . html com.mypackage</b>
</pre>

When javadoc is done, copy these generated files in <code>update</code>
over the original files in <code>html</code>.
<p>

Background information:  In general, when javadoc runs, it has the 
potential to generate links for names that appear throughout its 
generated pages: in signatures, <code>@see</code> tags, <code>{@link}</code> 
tags, summaries, hierarchies, the overview, and the index.  
Some of these links will go 
to pages generated in the current run, while other links
will potentially go to pages not generated in the current run.
<p>


<a name="linkoffline"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-linkoffline</b>&nbsp; <i>extdocURL</i>&nbsp; <i>packagelistLoc</i> <br>
<dd>
This option is a variation of <code>-link</code>; they both create 
links to documentation for  
<a href="#externalreferencedclasses">external referenced classes</a>.
You must use this option instead of <code>-link</code> if, at the 
time you run javadoc, the external document's <code>package-list</code> 
file does not exist at the <i>extdocURL</i> location (is "offline") 
but exists at a different location <i>packageListLoc</i> (typically local).
This can happen when the shell you are running javadoc in does not 
have web access to the <i>extdocURL</i>.  Thus, if <i>extdocURL</i> 
is accessible only on the World Wide Web, <code>-linkoffline</code> 
removes the constraint that javadoc have a web connection when 
generating the documentation.  
Examples are given below.
<p>

You can specify multiple <code>-linkoffline</code> options in a given
javadoc run.  (Prior to 1.2.2, it could be specified only once.)
<p>

The arguments are:
<p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><b><i>extdocURL</i></b> is the URL for the root location of the 
      external javadoc-generated documentation you want to link to.
      This location can be an absolute or relative URL
      -- if relative, make it relative to the destination 
      directory (specified with <code>-d</code>).
<p>
  <li><b><i>packagelistLoc</i></b> is the location to the directory containing 
      the <code>package-list</code> file for the external documentation.  
      This can be a URL (http: or file:) or file path, and can be absolute 
      or relative.  If relative, make it relative to the current directory 
      from where javadoc was run.
      Do not include the <code>package-list</code> filename.
</ul>
<p>

For example, if you want to link to the <code>java.lang</code> package at 
<code>http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api</code>, but your
shell does not have web access, then you could access the 
<code>package-list</code> file using 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/package-list"><code>http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/package-list</code></a>, 
save it to a local directory, and point to this local copy with <i>packagelistLoc</i>.
<p>

If a <code>package-list</code> file does not yet exist, but you know 
what package names your document will link to, you can create your 
own copy of this file by hand and specify its path with <i>packagelistLoc</i>.  
This is useful when you need to generate documentation that links
to new external documentation whose package names you know, but which is not 
yet published.  This is also a way of creating a <code>package-list</code>
file for linking to documentation generated with Javadoc 1.0 or 1.1, earlier
versions where <code>package-list</code> files were not generated. 
<p>

Two companies can share their unpublished <code>package-list</code> files,
enabling them to release their cross-linked documentation simultaneously.  
<p>

As shown below, to use this option, specify <i>extdocURL1</i>, 
the location of the javadoc-generated documentation for 
external referenced classes, and <i>packagelistLoc1</i>,
the location of its <code>package-list</code> file.  Include <code>-linkoffline</code>
once for each generated document you want to refer to (each option is shown 
on a separate line for clarity):
<p>

<code>% <b>javadoc -linkoffline</b> </code><i>extdocURL1</i><code> </code><i>packagelistLoc1</i><code> \<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-linkoffline</b> </code><i>extdocURL2</i><code> </code><i>packagelistLoc2</i><code> \<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</code>
<p>

For example, the following command adds links pointing to a document (specified 
by the first argument), for packages listed in the <code>package-list</code> file
(located by the second argument).

<pre><font size="-1">C:&gt; <b>javadoc -linkoffline http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api /jdk/1.3/docs/api/ ...</font></b></pre>
<p>

<a name="group"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-group</b>&nbsp; <var>groupheading</var>&nbsp; <var>packagepattern</var><code>:</code><var>packagepattern</var><code>:</code></var>...</var>
<dd>
Separates packages on the overview page into whatever groups you specify, 
one group per table.  You specify each group with a different 
<code>-group</code> option.  The groups appear on the page in the order 
specified on the command line; packages are alphabetized within a group. 
For a given <code>-group</code> option, the packages matching the
list of <var>packagepattern</var> expressions appear in a table 
with the heading <var>groupheading</var>.  
<p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><b><var>groupheading</var></b> can be any text, and can include white space.
   This text is placed in the table heading for the group.
<p>
  <li><b><var>packagepattern</var></b> can be any package name, 
   or can be the start of any package name followed by an asterisk 
   (<code>*</code>).  
   The asterisk is a wildcard meaning "match any characters".  This is 
   the only wildcard allowed. Multiple patterns can be included in  
   a group by separating them with semicolons (<code>;</code>).
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <b>NOTE: If using an asterisk in a pattern or pattern list, the
   pattern list must be inside quotes, such as <code>"java.lang*:java.util"</code></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you do not supply any <code>-group</code> option, all packages are 
placed in one group with the heading "Packages".  If the all groups do 
not include all documented packages, any leftover packages appear in a 
separate group with the heading "Other Packages".
<p>
For example, the following option separates the four documented 
packages into core, extension and other packages.  Notice the
trailing "dot" does not appear in "java.lang*" -- including the
dot, such as "java.lang.*" would omit the java.lang package.
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -group "Core Packages" "java.lang*:java.util"
            -group "Extension Packages" "javax.*"
            java.lang java.lang.reflect java.util javax.servlet java.new</b>
</pre>
This results in the groupings:
<blockquote>
<dl>
   <dt><b>Core Packages</b>
      <dd><code>java.lang</code>
      <dd><code>java.lang.reflect</code>
      <dd><code>java.util</code>
   <dt><b>Extension Packages</b>
      <dd><code>javax.servlet</code>
   <dt><b>Other Packages</b>
      <dd><code>java.new</code>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="nodeprecated"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-nodeprecated</b>
<dd>
Prevents the generation of any deprecated API at all 
in the documentation.  This does what -nodeprecatedlist 
does, plus it does not generate any deprecated API 
throughout the rest of the documentation.  This is 
useful when writing code and you don't want to 
be distracted by the deprecated code.
<p>

<a name="nodeprecatedlist"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-nodeprecatedlist</b>
<dd>
Prevents the generation of the file containing the list of 
deprecated APIs (deprecated-list.html) and the link in the 
navigation bar to that page.  (However, javadoc continues to generate 
the deprecated API throughout the rest of the document.)  
This is useful if your source code contains no deprecated API, 
and you want to make the navigation bar cleaner.
<p>

<a name="nosince"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-nosince </b>
<dd>
Omits from the generated docs the "Since" sections associated 
with the <a href="#@since">@since</a> tags.
<p>

<a name="notree"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-notree </b>
<dd>
Omits the class/interface hierarchy from the generated docs. The hierarchy is produced by default.
<p>

<a name="noindex"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-noindex </b>
<dd>
Omits the index from the generated docs.  The index is produced by default.
<p>

<a name="nohelp"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-nohelp</b>
<dd>
Omits the HELP link in the navigation bars at the top and 
bottom of each page of output.
<p>

<a name="nonavbar"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-nonavbar</b>
<dd>
Prevents the generation of the navigation bar, header and footer,
otherwise found at the top and bottom of the generated pages.  
Has no affect on the "bottom" option.  The <code>-nonavbar</code> option is 
useful when you are interested only in the content and have no need for
navigation, such as converting the files to PostScript or PDF for print only. 
<p>

<a name="helpfile"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-helpfile</b>&nbsp; <i>path\filename</i>
<dd>
Specifies the path of an alternate help file <i>path\filename</i> 
that the HELP link in the top and bottom navigation bars link to.  
Without this option, Javadoc automatically creates a help file 
<code>help-doc.html</code> that is hard-coded in Javadoc.  This 
option enables you to override this default.  The <i>filename</i>
can be any name and is not restricted to <code>help-doc.html</code> --
Javadoc will adjust the links in the navigation bar accordingly.
For example:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -helpfile C:\user\myhelp.html java.awt</b>
</pre>

<a name="stylesheetfile"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-stylesheetfile</b>&nbsp; <i>path\filename</i>
<dd>
Specifies the path of an alternate HTML stylesheet file.
Without this option, Javadoc automatically creates a stylesheet
file <code>stylesheet.css</code> that is hard-coded in Javadoc.  
This option enables you to override this default.
The <i>filename</i> can be any name and is not restricted to 
<code>stylesheet.css</code>.
For example:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -stylesheetfile C:\user\mystylesheet.css com.mypackage</b>
</pre>

<a name="serialwarn"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-serialwarn</b>
<dd>
Generates compile-time warnings for missing @serial tags.
By default, Javadoc 1.2.2 (and later versions) generates no serial 
warnings.  (This is a reversal from earlier versions.)
Use this option to display the serial warnings, which helps  
to properly document default serializable fields and 
<code>writeExternal</code> methods. 

<p>

<a name="charset"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-charset</b>&nbsp; <i>name</i>
<dd>
Specifies the HTML character set for this document. For example:
<pre>
  % <b>javadoc -charset "iso-8859-1" mypackage</b>
</pre>
would insert the following line in the head of every generated page:
<pre>
   &lt;META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;
</pre>
This META tag is described in the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.2.2">HTML standard</a>.
(4197265 and 4137321)
<p>

<a name="docencoding"><!-- --></a>
<dt><b>-docencoding</b>&nbsp; <i>name</i>
<dd>
Specifies the encoding of the generated HTML files.
<p>

<br>
<!-- ===================== SIMPLE EXAMPLES ========================= -->

<a name="examples"></a>
<h2>SIMPLE EXAMPLES</h2>
<blockquote>
You can run javadoc on entire packages or individual classes.
Each package name has a corresponding directory name. 
In the following examples, the source files are located at 
<code>C:\home\src\java\awt\*java</code>. The destination
directory is <code>C:\home\html</code>.

<a name="documentingpackages"></a>
<h3>Documenting One or More Packages</h3>

To document a package, the source files (<code>*.java</code>) for that package 
must be located in a directory having the same name as the package.
If a package name is made up of several identifiers (separated by
dots), each identifier represents a different directory.
Thus, all <code>java.awt</code> classes must reside in a directory named 
<code>java\awt\</code>.  You can run javadoc either of the following 
two ways -- by changing directories (with <code>cd</code>) or by 
using <code>-sourcepath</code> option.  You cannot use wildcards
to specify groups of packages.
<p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Case 1- Changing to the package directory</b> - 
      Change to the parent directory of the fully-qualified package.
      Then run javadoc, supplying names of one or more
      packages you want to document:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>cd C:\home\src\</b>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d C:\home\html java.awt java.awt.event</b>
</pre>

  <li><b>Case 2 - From any directory</b> -
      In this case, it doesn't matter what the current directory is.
      Run javadoc supplying <code>-sourcepath</code> with the parent directory
      of the fully-qualified package, and supply names of one or 
      more packages you want to document:
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d C:\home\html -sourcepath C:\home\src java.awt java.awt.event</b>
</pre>
</ul>

Both cases generate HTML-formatted documentation for the public and protected
classes and interfaces in packages <code>java.awt</code> and 
<code>java.awt.event</code> and save the HTML files in the specified 
destination directory (<code>C:\home\html</code>). Because two or more
packages are being generated, the document has three frames -- for the list of 
packages, the list of classes, and the main page.


<a name="documentingclasses"></a>
<h3>Documenting One or More Classes</h3>

The second way to run Javadoc is by passing in one or more source files 
(<code>.java</code>).  You can run javadoc either of the following two ways -- 
by changing directories (with <code>cd</code>) or by fully-specifying
the path to the <code>.java</code> files.  Relative paths are relative
to the current directory.  The <code>-sourcepath</code>
option is ignored when passing in source files. You can use command 
line wildcards, such as asterisk (*), to specify groups of classes.
<p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Case 1 - Changing to the source directory</b> - 
      Change to the directory holding the <code>.java</code> files.
      Then run javadoc, supplying names of one or more source files
      you want to document. 

<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>cd C:\home\src\java\awt</b>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d C:\home\html Button.java Canvas.java Graphics*.java</b>
</pre>

      This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the classes 
      <code>Button</code>, <code>Canvas</code> and classes beginning with 
      <code>Graphics</code>.  Because source files rather than package names 
      were passed in as arguments to javadoc, the document has two frames --
      for the list of classes and the main page.
<p>

  <li><b>Case 2 - Changing to the package root directory</b> - 
      This is useful for documenting individual source files from different
      subpackages off the same root. Change to the package root directory,
      and supply the source files with paths from the root. 
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>cd C:\home\src</b>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d \home\html java\awt\Button.java java\applet\Applet.java</b>
</pre>

      This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the classes 
      <code>Button</code> and <code>Applet</code>.
<p>

  <li><b>Case 3 - From any directory</b> -
      In this case, it doesn't matter what the current directory is.
      Run javadoc supplying the absolute path (or path relative to the 
      current directory) to the <code>.java</code> files
      you want to document.  
<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d C:\home\html C:\home\src\java\awt\Button.java C:\home\src\java\awt\Graphics*.java</b>
</pre>

      This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the class
      <code>Button</code> and classes beginning with <code>Graphics</code>.

</ul>


<a name="documentingboth"></a>
<h3>Documenting Both Packages and Classes</h3>

You can document entire packages and individual classes at the same time.
Here's an example that mixes two of the previous examples. 
You can use <code>-sourcepath</code> for the path to the packages but not
for the path to the individual classes. 

<pre>
  C:&gt; <b>javadoc -d C:\home\html -sourcepath C:\home\src java.awt C:\home\src\java\applet\Applet.java</b>
</pre>

      This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the package 
      <code>java.awt</code> and class <code>Applet</code>.
      (Javadoc determines the package name for <code>Applet</code> from the
      package declaration, if any, in the <code>Applet.java</code> source file.)

<!-- ================= REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE ========================= -->

<a name="realworldexample"></a>
<h2>REAL WORLD EXAMPLE</h2>

<blockquote>
Javadoc has many useful options, some of which are more commonly used
than others.  Here is effectively the command we use to run 
Javadoc on the Java platform API.  We use 180MB of memory to generate
the documentation for the 1500 (approx.) public and protected classes 
in the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.2.
<P>
The same example is shown twice -- first as executed on the command line,
then as executed from a makefile.  It uses absolute paths in the option
arguments, which enables the same Javadoc command to be run from any 
directory.

<B>NOTES</B> 
<UL>
   <LI>If you omit the <code>-windowtitle</code> option, Javadoc copies the doc title 
       to the window title.  The <code>-windowtitle</code> text is basically the same 
       as the <code>-doctitle</code> but without HTML tags, to prevent those tags from 
       appearing as raw text in the window title.
<P>
   <LI>If you omit the <code>-footer</code> option, as done here, Javadoc copies the 
       header text to the footer.
<p>
   <LI>Other important options you might want to use but not needed in this example are 
       -<a href="#classpath"><code>classpath</code></a> and -<a href="#link"><code>link</code></a>.

<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<blockquote>

<dl>

<a name="classpathenvironment"></a> 
<dt><code><b>CLASSPATH</b></code>
<dd>Environment variable that provides the path which javadoc uses to 
find user class files.  This environment variable is overridden by 
the <code>-classpath</code> option. 
Separate directories with a semicolon, for example:
<pre>
<dd>.;C:\classes;C:\home\java\classes
</pre>
